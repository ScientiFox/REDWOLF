<h3>Lycanthropy as a medical condition</h3>

Some modern researchers have tried to explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of <span id="Guy's_Hospital" title onclick="linkClicked(event);" style="color:blue;">Guy's Hospital</span>  in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital <span id="Porphyria" title onclick="linkClicked(event);" style="color:blue;">porphyria</span> , stating how the symptoms of <span id="Photosensitivity" title onclick="linkClicked(event);" style="color:blue;">photosensitivity</span> , reddish teeth, and <span id="Psychosis" title onclick="linkClicked(event);" style="color:blue;">psychosis</span>  could have been grounds for accusing a person of being a werewolf.[59] This is, however, argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims.[45] Others have pointed out the possibility of historical werewolves having been people with <span id="Hypertrichosis" title onclick="linkClicked(event);" style="color:blue;">hypertrichosis</span> , a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe.[45]
Woodward suggested <span id="Rabies" title onclick="linkClicked(event);" style="color:blue;">rabies</span>  as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies.[45] However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way is not part of the original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.[60]

Extractor example:

Summarize the following text as compactly as possible: "Here's my opening argument on the topic of predestination: **Point 1: The Bible does not explicitly teach predestination**, which means that the concept of predestination is not clearly stated or taught in Scripture. While the Bible does emphasize God's sovereignty and control over human events, it does not provide a systematic explanation for how God chooses certain individuals to salvation before the foundation of the world. **Point 2: The doctrine of predestination contradicts the biblical concept of free will**, which is a fundamental aspect of Christian theology. If God predetermines all events, including human decisions and actions, then do humans truly have control over their choices? This would undermine the idea that God's sovereignty and love are demonstrated through His provision of salvation to humanity. **Point 3: The Bible presents a more nuanced understanding of God's sovereignty**, which emphasizes God's initiative in salvation rather than predetermination. While God may choose certain individuals for salvation, He also initiates the process by calling them out of darkness and empowering them with the Holy Spirit (Ephesians 1:11). This perspective highlights God's active role in human decision-making while still acknowledging His sovereignty over all things. By presenting these three points, I aim to challenge the notion that predestination is a Scripturally supported doctrine and highlight the need for further biblical exposition on this topic." in the context of the topic "Predestination is not biblically supported".

""Think It Over" is a 1978 song by Cheryl Ladd. It was released as a single from her eponymous debut album. The song was released following the second season of Charlie's Angels, the first in which Ladd was cast.

The song became a top 40 hit in the United States and Canada on both the pop singles charts as well as the Adult Contemporary charts. It had its best showing on the Canadian AC chart, where it peaked at No. 29.[2] The single was also released in the UK, the Netherlands and Japan.[3]

"Think It Over" was Ladd's only song to chart, although another track from the album, her original version of "I'll Never Love This Way Again", became a top 5 hit when covered by Dionne Warwick in 1979.[4] "
