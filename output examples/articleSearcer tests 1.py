Debating the topic:  Predestination

Point:  position one 99.9
     <think>
Okay, the user wants me to argue in favor of predestination, taking position one. First, I need to clarify what position one is. Since the topic is predestination, position one is likely the stance that predestination is true. So, I need to make a strong, concise argument supporting that.

I should start by defining predestination as the belief that all events, including human actions, are determined by a higher power. Then, I can use theological arguments, like divine omniscience and omnipotence. If God knows everything and can do anything, then everything must be predestined. Also, citing religious texts, like the Bible, where God is described as having foreknowledge and control over events.

Another angle is the logical consistency of free will versus predestination. If God is all-knowing, then free will might be an illusion. The argument from necessity and perfection: a perfect God would have a perfect plan, so everything is predestined. Maybe mention the concept of divine providence, where God guides all events towards a purpose.

I should also address counterarguments briefly, like free will, but refute them by saying that free will exists within the framework of God's plan. Maybe mention how human choices are still part of the divine plan. Need to keep it concise, so focus on the main points without getting too detailed. Make sure the argument is strong and logical, using both theological and philosophical reasoning.
</think>

Predestination is the belief that all events, including human actions, are determined by a higher power, such as God, who has perfect knowledge and omnipotence. If God is omniscient (all-knowing) and omnipotent (all-powerful), then His foreknowledge of every event and His ability to enact it necessitate that all outcomes are preordained. This aligns with theological doctrines like divine providence, where God’s will unfolds perfectly, ensuring harmony and purpose in creation. Free will, often cited as a counterargument, is an illusion if God’s sovereignty is absolute—human choices exist within the framework of His eternal plan. Thus, predestination upholds the coherence of divine attributes and the certainty of a purposeful universe.

Debating the topic:  Predestination

Point:  Predestination suggests that certain choices or actions are predetermined by an external entity rather than a choice made by an individual. 41.0
     Predestination, as it pertains to the concept of preordained choices or actions, presents an intriguing perspective on human agency and free will. While some may argue that such ideas suggest a lack of control over our lives, I contend that this notion actually underscores the profound complexity and interconnectedness of existence.

Firstly, by acknowledging the role of external forces in shaping our paths, we can better appreciate the multitude of factors influencing our decisions and actions. This understanding fosters empathy towards others and promotes a sense of responsibility for our choices. It also highlights the importance of making informed decisions based on available information and circumstances.

Secondly, recognizing predestination does not negate free will entirely; rather, it emphasizes that while certain aspects of life may be predetermined, individuals still retain autonomy in their decision-making process. This duality allows for a balanced exploration of human potential and encourages personal growth through the exercise of choice within specific constraints.

Moreover, embracing predestination can lead to greater acceptance of life's unpredictability and challenges. By acknowledging external forces at play, we become more prepared to adapt and navigate unforeseen circumstances with resilience.

In conclusion, while predestination may seem to strip away individual freedom, it actually enriches our understanding of the human experience by highlighting the intricate interplay between destiny and personal agency. This perspective encourages a deeper appreciation for life's complexities and promotes greater empathy towards others as we recognize the myriad influences shaping their lives.

Point:  In contrast, some argue that personal responsibility plays a role in determining our decisions and outcomes. 33
     Personal responsibility is crucial for shaping one's life path as it allows individuals to take control over their destiny by making informed decisions about their actions and choices. In contrast, predestination often implies that certain events or outcomes are predetermined based on historical patterns or cosmic forces, which would undermine the ability of individuals to influence their own lives.

Supporting the argument for personal responsibility:

1. **Personal Autonomy**: Individuals have the right to make choices that align with their values and beliefs. The choice between making a decision and letting fate determine its outcome demonstrates the importance of personal autonomy in shaping one's life.

2. **Decisive Power**: One's ability to make decisions can significantly impact their future. Decisions about education, career paths, relationships, and other significant aspects of life shape individuals' lives in meaningful ways. Without personal responsibility, these choices would be less meaningful and less impactful on the individual.

3. **Personal Growth**: Making responsible decisions helps individuals learn from their experiences and grow as individuals. This growth is essential for forming healthy habits, building resilience, and achieving personal goals.

4. **Choice Over Destiny**: Personal responsibility empowers people to shape their own destiny rather than being victims of predetermined outcomes. This gives them the ability to change their circumstances if they choose to do so.

5. **Impact on Others**: The decisions made by individuals have a ripple effect on others, as they affect their social relationships and influence the lives of those around them. Personal responsibility ensures that these decisions are not only beneficial for oneself but also contribute positively to society.

6. **Freedom from Fate**: By taking control of one's destiny through personal responsibility, individuals can break free from the constraints imposed by predestination and choose paths that align with their values and aspirations.

In conclusion, personal responsibility is essential for making choices that shape one's life in a way that is meaningful and beneficial to oneself. It provides individuals with the freedom to make choices that are aligned with their values, have a positive impact on others, and contribute positively to society. Without personal responsibility, we would be living without choice or control over our lives, which would undermine our ability to thrive as individuals and members of society.

Round 1:

Point:  Predestination suggests that certain choices or actions are predetermined by an external entity rather than a choice made by an individual. 80.4 6.9
     Personal responsibility plays a crucial role in determining one's life path, according to the argument presented on Predestination. The argument emphasizes that taking accountability for actions fosters self-awareness and empowerment by encouraging individuals to take ownership of their choices and outcomes. Additionally, it highlights resilience building as an outcome through personal decision-making efforts and the ability to overcome challenges. Empowerment is further supported by recognizing one's responsibility in shaping their own destinies while contributing positively to society.

Point:  In contrast, some argue that personal responsibility plays a role in determining our decisions and outcomes. 57.2 15.5
     The argument presented in the debate revolves around the significance of personal responsibility in shaping individuals' lives, particularly in light of predestination. The key points made by both sides of the debate include:

- **Personal Responsibility**: It is argued that while predestination provides insights into historical patterns and cosmic forces, it does not negate or undermine the importance of personal responsibility.

- **External Influences**: This side emphasizes that external factors such as cultural norms and societal structures can significantly influence our decisions. However, they also acknowledge that these influences do play a role in shaping our lives.

- **Cultural Context**: The argument highlights that individual responsibility often reflects cultural values and norms, which may vary across societies. It suggests that personal autonomy is valued differently in different cultures.

- **Societal Expectations**: While societal expectations can contribute to the responsibilities of individuals regarding their actions and decisions, they do not absolve one from making responsible choices.

- **Individual Choice vs. Collective Impact**: The argument acknowledges the balance between individual responsibility and collective impact on society. It suggests that while personal choices have a significant influence on outcomes, it is crucial for individuals to consider the broader societal implications of their decisions.

- **Future Predictability and Change**: This perspective considers how future predictions might shape one's life, but emphasizes that personal responsibility allows for meaningful choices even when they may seem out of step with current trends or historical patterns.

Round 2:

Point:  Predestination suggests that certain choices or actions are predetermined by an external entity rather than a choice made by an individual. 66.1 9.3
     The debate on Predestination emphasizes the significance of personal responsibility in shaping individuals' lives. While predestination may offer a broader perspective on historical patterns and cosmic forces, it does not negate the role of personal agency. Recognizing one's role in shaping their own destinies fosters self-awareness and empowerment, enabling informed decision-making aligned with values and aspirations.

The influence of cultural norms and societal structures is acknowledged to vary across contexts, highlighting the need for balance between personal responsibility and collective impact. While society sets standards and pressures influencing choices, individuals must remain true to their values and goals in navigating social landscapes effectively.

Personal accountability plays a crucial role in understanding individual autonomy's variations across different environments. Embracing change and taking proactive steps towards desired futures aligns with embracing change in the face of unpredictability inherent in life.

Point:  In contrast, some argue that personal responsibility plays a role in determining our decisions and outcomes. 45.7 9.6
     The argument presented emphasizes the interplay between predestination and personal responsibility within the context of moral decision-making. Predestination, viewed from an external lens, suggests insights into historical patterns and cosmic forces, while also highlighting how cultural norms and societal structures influence individual choices.

This perspective acknowledges that these influences play a significant role in shaping one's life, yet it highlights the importance of recognizing individual autonomy as a crucial factor in personal responsibility. The argument underscores the need to consider both individual choices and broader societal expectations when evaluating responsibilities.

By recognizing that societal expectations can shape individual actions, the debate encourages individuals to make decisions that align with their values and aspirations, despite the potential for future predictability influenced by these forces. This approach emphasizes the complexity of human life and the ongoing nature of personal responsibility in an unpredictable world.

Round 3:

Point:  Predestination suggests that certain choices or actions are predetermined by an external entity rather than a choice made by an individual. 52.2 5.2
     The debate on "Predestination" highlights the intricate relationship between predestination (historical patterns or cosmic forces) and personal responsibility in moral decision-making. It emphasizes that societal norms and expectations significantly influence individual choices, suggesting an interplay where external factors shape lives while personal agency remains essential. The argument also posits that navigating life's challenges requires understanding both these influences to foster informed decisions.

Point:  In contrast, some argue that personal responsibility plays a role in determining our decisions and outcomes. 30.9 5.2
     The debate on Predestination is a complex topic that involves understanding the influence of societal norms, cultural expectations, personal agency, and broader societal contexts in shaping individual decisions. While these factors play significant roles in influencing life outcomes, they do not entirely determine our lives. The interplay between predestination and personal responsibility highlights the complexity of moral decision-making.
----
Conclusion:  4.7
     The debate on "Predestination" explores the complex relationship between historical patterns or cosmic forces and personal responsibility in determining decisions. Both arguments emphasize that societal norms and expectations significantly influence individual choices, suggesting an interplay where external factors shape lives while personal agency remains essential. The argument also posits that navigating life's challenges requires understanding both these influences to foster informed decisions.

Debating the topic:  Predestination

Point:  The existence of an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose guides our moral and ethical choices. 57.4
     The existence of an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose indeed plays a significant role in guiding our moral and ethical choices. This concept, often referred to as predestination or predestined fate, is rooted in various philosophical and religious traditions. 

Firstly, the idea of an inherent destiny can provide individuals with a sense of direction and purpose in life. When we believe that there is a predetermined path for us, it can alleviate existential anxiety by providing clarity on our role within society. This belief also encourages individuals to act responsibly towards others as they understand the potential impact of their actions on future generations.

Secondly, embracing an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose fosters a greater sense of empathy and understanding among people. If we recognize that there is a larger plan at work beyond our immediate control, it can help us appreciate the interconnectedness of all lives and promote compassion for those who are less fortunate. This perspective encourages individuals to contribute positively towards society by addressing social issues and striving to make a meaningful difference in the world.

Moreover, acknowledging an inherent destiny or purpose can also motivate people to strive for excellence and personal growth. By understanding that their actions have consequences not only for themselves but also for future generations, individuals are more likely to prioritize ethical decision-making and take responsibility for their choices. This sense of accountability can lead to a more just society where moral values are upheld.

Lastly, the concept of predestination encourages introspection and self-reflection. Recognizing that there is an ultimate plan or purpose in life allows people to examine their own beliefs, values, and actions more closely. This process can help individuals gain valuable insights into themselves and make conscious choices aligned with their true nature, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling existence.

In conclusion, the existence of an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose guides our moral and ethical choices by providing direction, fostering empathy, promoting personal growth, encouraging responsibility, and facilitating introspection. While some may argue that this belief contradicts individual agency, it is essential to recognize that acknowledging predestined fate does not negate one's ability to make meaningful decisions within the context of their predetermined path.

Point:  There is no clear-cut answer to what happens after death, leaving us in a state of uncertainty and personal interpretation. 25
     While there may be religious beliefs that emphasize predestination or destiny, such as in Christianity, Buddhism, or Judaism, these are belief systems rather than universal truths. The concept of predestination is based on the premise that events will unfold according to predetermined plans rather than free agency.

In contrast, personal interpretation suggests that each individual's experiences and decisions are unique and influenced by their circumstances, emotions, and personal beliefs. This perspective acknowledges that every person has a different perspective on what happens after death and that interpretations can vary greatly based on cultural and personal factors.

The decision to accept or reject predestination depends on one's religious beliefs and the specific belief systems they subscribe to. If someone believes in predestination as a divine mandate, it may provide a sense of structure and purpose for their life. However, if someone prefers personal interpretation, they might find comfort in knowing that while there is no clear-cut answer, each person's path will unfold based on their individual circumstances.

Furthermore, the belief in personal interpretation does not contradict the idea of free will. While the universe may be governed by predetermined events, it is up to individuals to interpret those events as meaningful or meaningless to them. The key point is that the interpretation of one's life after death is subjective and varies from person to person based on their beliefs, experiences, and perspectives.

In conclusion, while there are no clear-cut answers to what happens after death, personal interpretation suggests that each individual will have a unique and personalized experience based on their own beliefs and circumstances. This perspective offers a more balanced view of life after death by acknowledging the subjective nature of human experiences without sacrificing the possibility for personal growth and fulfillment.
----
Round 1:

Point:  The existence of an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose guides our moral and ethical choices. 72.4 12.3
     The debate on Predestination presents an interesting perspective by arguing against the notion of a universal truth about fate and destiny. The argument challenges the idea that all individuals can have a predetermined path based solely on their religious or philosophical beliefs. It highlights the diversity in belief systems across different cultures, suggesting that each person's understanding of life after death is subject to personal interpretation.

Moreover, by acknowledging the subjective nature of human experiences, such as emotions and circumstances, it suggests that decisions made within one's predetermined path should still be influenced by their individual perspectives and beliefs. This perspective acknowledges that individuals have the power to make meaningful choices even if events unfold according to predetermined plans.

The argument further addresses the question of free will, suggesting that accepting predestination does not necessarily negate an individual's ability to consider these events in ways that shape their lives positively for society. It also emphasizes that while destiny may play a role for some individuals within specific belief systems, it is essential to recognize its limitations and subjectivity.

In conclusion, the debate on Predestination successfully counters the initial argument by emphasizing the importance of recognizing the complexity and diversity of beliefs about fate and destiny across different belief systems and cultures. It challenges the notion that all individuals can have a predetermined path based solely on their religious or philosophical frameworks and acknowledges the subjective nature of human experiences in shaping life choices.

Point:  There is no clear-cut answer to what happens after death, leaving us in a state of uncertainty and personal interpretation. 60.6 9.3
     The argument presented revolves around the idea that predestination might not be a universally valid belief but could still provide guidance on how to make choices within predetermined paths. The debate highlights key points such as the diversity of beliefs about destiny across different cultures and religions, the flexibility afforded by personal interpretation in making decisions, and whether predestination inherently limits our ability to make meaningful choices based on free will.

The argument is not solely focused on the universality of predestination but rather on its potential role as a guiding principle for personal decision-making. The debate also touches upon the implications of belief systems versus individual experiences when discussing concepts like destiny or fate.
----
Round 2:

Point:  The existence of an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose guides our moral and ethical choices. 51.0 4.9
     The debate on Predestination suggests that while destiny is a universal concept, it can be interpreted and acted upon through personal beliefs and values. This approach recognizes that individuals have agency and can make meaningful decisions even when events conform to predetermined paths. It emphasizes the importance of free will and the role of individual interpretation in guiding life choices.

Point:  There is no clear-cut answer to what happens after death, leaving us in a state of uncertainty and personal interpretation. 26.7 9.6
     The argument presented revolves around the concept of predestination, emphasizing its multifaceted role in shaping an individual's life even within predetermined paths. It acknowledges the universality of predestination while recognizing its diverse role as a guiding principle that influences personal decisions and moral guidance based on different beliefs across cultures and religions.

While this perspective highlights universal truths about fate not existing, it also posits that there is room for personal interpretation and ethical decision-making based on these beliefs. The argument suggests that understanding one's destiny can provide clarity on navigating life's complexities, ultimately leading to more purposeful actions aligned with individual values.

In contrast to the opponent's position, which emphasizes predestination as a rigid constraint, this argument offers a balanced view by acknowledging the diversity of human experiences and the flexibility offered by diverse belief systems. It highlights that while universal truths may not exist, there is room for personal interpretation and ethical guidance based on these beliefs. The conclusion further strengthens this argument by emphasizing the role of predestination in shaping our ethical choices and its potential to enrich discussions surrounding the nature of destiny and personal decision-making.

Round 3:

Point:  The existence of an unknowable ultimate destiny or purpose guides our moral and ethical choices. 49.7 6.2
     The debate on the argument "Predestination" focuses on whether fate is a universal presence or if individuals have agency in their lives. The opponent's perspective acknowledges the significance of fate but emphasizes the importance of individual interpretation, suggesting that diverse belief systems can contribute to moral and ethical choices. This approach highlights the adaptability of predestination by allowing for flexible decision-making based on unique values and beliefs. However, the argument also argues for recognizing the role of free will in shaping our actions within a predetermined framework.

Point:  There is no clear-cut answer to what happens after death, leaving us in a state of uncertainty and personal interpretation. 54.2 17.0
     Your argument on Predestination, which posits that our beliefs and interpretations of destiny can shape moral decisions, aligns well with my previous discussion on predestination's impact on individual actions. However, I would like to suggest a few additional points to further support this perspective:

1. **Personal Agency in Destiny**: While your view suggests that one's destiny may be predetermined, it does not imply that our agency is undervalued or limited by destiny. This highlights the importance of recognizing that personal choices and actions play a significant role in determining outcomes.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: Your argument emphasizes the value of understanding the context in which events occur as an ethical compass. While predestination suggests certain events are predetermined, it does not dismiss the significance of our individual perspectives in shaping these events through our decisions.

3. **Balancing Perspectives**: You underscore the importance of considering multiple belief systems and interpretations of destiny to provide a balanced view on how predestination influences moral choices. This perspective acknowledges that while destiny may have implications for our lives, we can also navigate this influence by making informed decisions grounded in personal agency.

4. **Relevance Today's Discussion**: While your primary focus is on the impact of predestination on individual decision-making, it also reflects the ongoing dialogue about how to reconcile different belief systems with ethical principles in today's context. This perspective underscores the necessity for a nuanced understanding of destiny and moral choices in an evolving world.

In conclusion, while your argument offers valuable insights by emphasizing the importance of understanding one’s destiny as an ethical compass, I believe there is still room for further exploration to ensure that our perspectives on predestination are balanced and informed by current discussions about personal agency, context, and modern ethics.

Conclusion:  12.2 468.9
     The debate concerning the concept of "Predestination" highlights two distinct arguments: one emphasizing the inherent unknowability of ultimate destiny or purpose and another focusing on the influence individuals have in shaping their lives through moral choices. The first argument underscores that a predetermined destiny can guide our ethical choices, but it does not imply that personal agency is undervalued or limited by destiny. This perspective suggests flexibility in decision-making based on unique values and beliefs while recognizing the importance of understanding the context in which events occur as an ethical compass.

Conversely, the second argument highlights the significance of personal interpretation and the value of diverse belief systems contributing to moral choices. It emphasizes that our beliefs and actions can shape destiny within a predetermined framework, emphasizing the role of individual agency in navigating this influence. This perspective acknowledges the importance of balancing perspectives by considering multiple belief systems and interpretations of destiny.

In summary, while your argument offers valuable insights into understanding destiny as an ethical compass, I believe there is still room for further exploration to ensure that our perspectives on predestination are balanced and informed by current discussions about personal agency, context, and modern ethics.

**Main Concept: Myth**

A myth is a complex body of stories that describe origins, beliefs, events, or phenomena. They often have symbolic meaning and are used by cultures for moral instruction, religious guidance, entertainment, and cultural transmission.

**Etymology & Historical Development**

- **Greek Origins**: The word "myth" comes from Greek *myo* “to make” (from *mio* “I am”), indicating stories that are based on legends. In classical times it referred to a narrative about gods who lived in the afterlife.
  
- **Roman Myths**: Roman myths were structured around deities and incorporated various aspects of human life, politics, and religion.

- **Early Christian Mythology**: Greek influences continued into early Christianity as mythos (Greek) was used by the Church Fathers to discuss spiritual truths. Early Christians also began to use these stories in their writings.
  
**Cultural & Societal Implications**

- In literature, myths are central narratives that shape cultural identity and can be read across generations.

- They often serve social functions such as moral instruction, prophecy, entertainment, or cultural transmission.

- Modern myth criticism examines how modern culture interprets and uses myths to understand contemporary issues.

**Interpretations & Related Concepts**

- **Comparative Mythology**: Researchers study the similarities and differences between myths from different cultures. This approach helps in understanding shared values and human behavior across diverse traditions.
  
- **Functionalism**: Scholars argue that myths serve functions such as forming societies, shaping behaviors, and serving as cultural artifacts.

- **Mythopoeia**: The concept of mythopoeia refers to the "conscious generation" or mental model created by mythology. It suggests that the ability to understand a particular culture’s myths reflects its worldview.
  
- **Euhemerism**: This theory holds that myths were initially invented as allegories for natural phenomena, which gradually became taken literally and in turn influenced how people interpreted and used them later.

**Relevance Today**

Myths continue to be studied across disciplines such as anthropology, literature, philosophy (especially in relation to mythology), and even computer science. They are essential in understanding human culture, belief systems, myths may inspire technology or art, and they help us explore the roots of our society's values and practices.

**Key Themes & Ideas**

- **Storytelling**: Myths often function as narratives that recount historical events, moral lessons, spiritual truths, or cultural transmission.
  
- **Symbolism**: Myth works through symbolic elements such as gods, heroes, natural forces, and everyday objects. These symbols can represent abstract ideas and enhance understanding.

- **Cultural Transmission**: Traditional myths are passed down orally from one generation to the next; some may later be transformed into written literature or performed by artists for entertainment.

In summary, a myth is an intricate narrative that serves various roles in culture—from storytelling to moral instruction—to shaping societies, providing cultural frameworks, and informing contemporary debates.

The
The (/ðə,
ðiː/
) is a grammatical article  in English , denoting persons or things that are already or about to be mentioned, under discussion, implied or otherwise presumed familiar to listeners, readers, or speakers. It is the definite article  in English. The is the most frequently used word  in the English language; studies and analyses of texts have found it to account for seven percent of all printed English-language words.[1] It is derived from gendered articles in Old English  which combined in Middle English  and now has a single form used with nouns of any gender.[lower-alpha 1] The word can be used with both singular and plural nouns, and with a noun that starts with any letter. This is different from many other languages, which have different forms of the definite article for different genders or numbers.

###Article: Werewolf
Werewolf
In folklore , a werewolf[lower-alpha 1] (from
Old English
werwulf  'man-wolf'), or occasionally lycanthrope[lower-alpha 2] (from
Ancient Greek
λυκάνθρωπος , lykánthrōpos, 'wolf-human'), is an individual who can shape-shift  into a wolf  (or especially in modern film, a therianthropic
hybrid  wolf-like creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse  or affliction (often a bite or the occasional scratch from another werewolf), with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon .[lower-alpha 3] Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called lycanthropy,[lower-alpha 4] are Petronius  (27–66) and Gervase of Tilbury  (1150–1228).

Urban legend 
The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore , existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation  of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period . From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World  with colonialism . Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches , in the course of the Late Middle Ages  and the early modern period . Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland  (especially the Valais  and Vaud ) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.
The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the "witch-hunt " phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials.[lower-alpha 5] During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of Peter Stumpp  (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves , primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of wolf-charmers  recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia  and Styria .[lower-alpha 6]
After the end of the witch trials, the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies  and in the emerging Gothic horror  genre; werewolf fiction  as a genre has premodern precedents in medieval romances  (e.g., Bisclavret  and Guillaume de Palerme ) and developed in the 18th century out of the "semi-fictional" chapbook  tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern popular culture .

Names
The Modern English 
werewolf descends from the Old English 
wer(e)wulf, which is a cognate  of Middle Dutch 
weerwolf, Middle Low German 
warwulf, werwulf, Middle High German 
werwolf, and West Frisian 
waer-ûl(e).[1] These terms are generally derived from a Proto-Germanic  form reconstructed  as *wira-wulfaz ('man-wolf'), itself from an earlier Pre-Germanic  form *wiro-wulpos.[2][3][4] An alternative reconstruction, *wazi-wulfaz ('wolf-clothed'), would bring the Germanic compound  closer to the Slavic meaning,[2] with other semantic parallels in Old Norse 
úlfheðnar ('wolf-skinned') and úlfheðinn ('wolf-coat'), Old Irish 
luchthonn ('wolf-skin'), and Sanskrit 
Vṛkājina ('Wolf-skin').[5]
The Norse branch underwent taboo modifications , with Old Norse vargúlfr (only attested as a translation of Old French 
garwaf ~ garwal(f) from Marie's lay  of Bisclavret ) replacing *wiraz ('man') with vargr ('wolf, outlaw'), perhaps under the influence of the Old French expression leus warous ~ lous garous (modern loup-garou), which literally means 'wolf-werewolf'.[6][7] The modern Norse form varulv (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) was either borrowed from Middle Low German werwulf,[7] or else derived from an unattested Old Norse *varulfr, posited as the regular descendant of Proto-Germanic *wira-wulfaz.[3] An Old Frankish  form *werwolf is inferred from the Middle Low German variant and was most likely borrowed into Old Norman 
garwa(l)f ~ garo(u)l, with regular Germanic –Romance  correspondence w- / g- (cf. William / Guillaume, Wales / Galles, etc.).[7][8]
The Proto-Slavic  noun *vьlko-dlakь, meaning "wolf-haired" (cf. *dlaka, "animal hair", "fur"),[2] can be reconstructed from Serbian vukòdlak, Slovenian 
vołkodlȃk, and Czech vlkodlak, although formal variations in Slavic languages  (*vьrdl(j)ak, *vьlkdolk, *vьlklak) and the late attestation of some forms pose difficulties in tracing the origin of the term.[9][10] The Greek
Vrykolakas  and Romanian 
Vîrcolac, designating vampire-like creatures in Balkan folklores, were borrowed from Slavic languages.[11][12] The same form is also found in other non-Slavic languages of the region, such as Albanian vurvolak and Turkish vurkolak.[12]
Bulgarian 
vьrkolak and Church Slavonic 
vurkolak may be interpreted as back-borrowings from Greek.[10] The name vurdalak  (вурдалак; 'ghoul, revenant') first appeared in Russian poet Alexander Pushkin 's work Pesni, published in 1835. The source of Pushkin's distinctive form remains debated in scholarship.[13][12]
A Proto-Celtic  noun *wiro-kū, meaning 'man-dog', has been reconstructed from Celtiberian 
uiroku, the Old Brittonic  place-name Viroconium  (Old Irish  noun ferchu ('male dog, fierce dog'), and the medieval personal names Guurci (Old Welsh ) and Gurki (Old Breton ). Wolves were metaphorically designated as 'dogs' in Celtic cultures.[14][4]
The modern term lycanthropy comes from Ancient Greek 
lukanthrōpía (λυκανθρωπία), itself from lukánthrōpos (λυκάνθρωπος), meaning 'wolf-man'. Ancient writers used the term solely in the context of clinical lycanthropy , a condition in which the patient imagined himself to be a wolf. Modern writers later used lycanthrope as a synonym of werewolf, referring to a person who, according to medieval superstition, could assume the form of wolves.[15]

History
Indo-European comparative mythology
The European motif of the devilish werewolf devouring human flesh harks back to a common development during the Middle Ages  in the context of Christianity, although stories of humans turning into wolves take their roots in earlier pre-Christian beliefs.[16][17]
Their underlying common origin can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European mythology , where lycanthropy is reconstructed as an aspect of the initiation of the kóryos  warrior class, which may have included a cult focused on dogs and wolves identified with an age grade of young, unmarried warriors.[4] The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is McCone (1987).[18]
Classical antiquity
Ancient Greek literature  and Folklore . Herodotus , in his Histories ,[19] wrote that according to what the Scythians and the Greeks settled in Scythia told him, the Neuri , which was a tribe to the north-east of Scythia , were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days and then changed back to their human shape. He added that he is not convinced by the story but the locals swear to its truth.[20] This tale was also mentioned by Pomponius Mela .[21]
In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias  related the story of King Lycaon  of Arcadia, who was transformed into a wolf because he had sacrificed a child in the altar of Zeus Lycaeus.[22] In the version of the legend told by Ovid  in his Metamorphoses ,[23] when Zeus  visits Lycaon disguised as a common man, Lycaon wants to test if he is really a god. To that end, he kills a Molossian hostage and serve his entrails to Zeus. Disgusted, the god turns Lycaon into a wolf. However, in other accounts of the legend, like that of Apollodorus'  Bibliotheca,[24] Zeus blasts him and his sons with thunderbolts as punishment.
Pausanias also relates the story of an Arcadian man called Damarchus  of Parrhasia, who was turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child sacrificed to Zeus  Lycaeus. He was restored to human form 10 years later and went on to become an Olympic champion.[25] This tale is also recounted by Pliny the Elder , who calls the man Demaenetus quoting Agriopas .[26] According to Pausanias, this was not a one-off event, but that men have been transformed into wolves during the sacrifices to Zeus Lycaeus since the time of Lycaon. If they abstain from tasting human flesh while being wolves, they would be restored to human form nine years later, but if they do not abstain, they would remain wolves forever.[22]
Lykos (Λύκος) of Athens was a wolf-shaped herο, whose shrine stood by the jurycourt, and the first jurors were named after him.[27]
Pliny the Elder likewise recounts another tale of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes,[28] he mentions that in Arcadia , once a year a man was chosen by lot from the Anthus' clan. The chosen man was escorted to a marsh in the area, where he hung his clothes into an oak  tree, swam across the marsh and transformed into a wolf, joining a pack  for nine years. If during these nine years he refrained from tasting human flesh, he returned to the same marsh, swam back, and recovered his previous human form, with nine years added to his appearance.[29] Ovid also relates stories of men who roamed the woods of Arcadia  in the form of wolves.[30][31]
Virgil , in his poetic work Eclogues , wrote about a man called Moeris, who used herbs and poisons picked in his native Pontus  to turn himself into a wolf.[32] In prose , the Satyricon , written circa AD 60 by Gaius Petronius Arbiter , one of the characters, Niceros, tells a story at a banquet about a friend who turned into a wolf (chs. 61–62). He describes the incident as follows, "When I look for my buddy I see he'd stripped and piled his clothes by the roadside... He pees in a circle round his clothes and then, just like that, turns into a wolf!... after he turned into a wolf he started howling and then ran off into the woods."[33]
Early Christian authors also mentioned werewolves. In The City of God, Augustine of Hippo  gives an account similar to that found in Pliny the Elder. Augustine explains that "It is very generally believed that by certain witches spells men may be turned into wolves..."[34] Physical metamorphosis was also mentioned in the Capitulatum Episcopi, attributed to the Council of Ancyra  in the 4th century, which became the Church's doctrinal text in relation to magic, witches, and transformations such as those of werewolves.[35] The Capitulatum Episcopi states that "Whoever believes that anything can be...transformed into another species or likeness, except by God Himself...is beyond doubt an infidel.'[35]
In these works of Roman writers, werewolves often receive the name versipellis ("turnskin"). Augustine instead uses the phrase "in lupum fuisse mutatum" (changed into the form of a wolf) to describe the physical metamorphosis of werewolves, which is similar to phrases used in the medieval period.
Middle Ages
There is evidence of widespread belief in werewolves in medieval Europe. This evidence spans much of the Continent, as well as the British Isles. Werewolves were mentioned in Medieval law codes, such as that of King Cnut , whose Ecclesiastical Ordinances inform us that the codes aim to ensure that "...the madly audacious werewolf do not too widely devastate, nor bite too many of the spiritual flock."[36]
Liutprand of Cremona  reports a rumor that Bajan, son of Simeon I of Bulgaria , could use magic to turn himself into a wolf.[37] The works of Augustine of Hippo had a large influence on the development of Western Christianity, and were widely read by churchmen of the medieval period; and these churchmen occasionally discussed werewolves in their works. Famous examples include Gerald of Wales 's Werewolves of Ossory , found in his Topographica Hibernica, and in Gervase of Tilbury's
Otia Imperiala , both written for royal audiences.
Gervase reveals to the reader that belief in such transformations (he also mentions women turning into cats and into snakes) was widespread across Europe; he uses the phrase "que ita dinoscuntur" when discussing these metamorphoses, which translates to "it is known". Gervase, who was writing in Germany, also tells the reader that the transformation of men into wolves cannot be easily dismissed, for "...in England we have often seen men change into wolves" ("Vidimus enim frequenter in Anglia per lunationes homines in lupos mutari...").[38] Further evidence of the widespread belief in werewolves and other human-animal transformations can be seen in theological attacks made against such beliefs. Conrad of Hirsau , writing in the 11th century, forbids the reading of stories in which a person's reason is obscured following such a transformation.[39] Conrad specifically refers to the tales of Ovid in his tract. Pseudo-Augustine, writing in the 12th century, follows Augustine of Hippo's argument that no physical transformation can be made by any but God, stating that "...the body corporeally [cannot], be changed into the material limbs of any animal.'[40]
Marie de France 's poem Bisclavret  (c. 1200) is another example, in which the eponymous nobleman Bisclavret, for reasons not described, had to transform into a wolf every week. When his treacherous wife stole his clothing needed to restore his human form, he escaped the king's wolf hunt by imploring the king for mercy and accompanied the king thereafter. His behavior at court was gentle, until his wife and her new husband appeared at court, so much so that his hateful attack on the couple was deemed justly motivated, and the truth was revealed. This lai  (a type of Breton sung-poem) follows many themes found within other werewolf tales – the removal of clothing and attempting to refrain from the consumption of human flesh can be found in Pliny the Elder, as well as in the second of Gervase of Tilbury's werewolf stories, about a werewolf by the name of Chaucevaire. Marie also reveals to us the existence of werewolf belief in Breton and Norman France, by telling us the Franco-Norman word for werewolf: garwulf, which, she explains, are common in that part of France, where "...many men turned into werewolves".[41] Gervase also supports this terminology when he tells us that the French use the term "gerulfi" to describe what the English call "werewolves".[42]
Melion  and Biclarel are two anonymous lais that share the theme of a werewolf knight being betrayed by his wife.[43]
The German word werwolf was recorded by Burchard von Worms  in the 11th century and Bertold of Regensburg  in the 13th century but is not recorded in all of medieval German poetry or fiction. While Baring-Gould argues that references to werewolves were also rare in England, presumably because whatever significance the "wolf-men" of Germanic paganism had carried, the associated beliefs and practices had been successfully repressed after Christianization (or if they persisted, they did so outside of the sphere of literacy available to us), we have sources other than those mentioned above.[44] Such examples of werewolves in Ireland and the British Isles can be found in the work of the 9th century Welsh monk Nennius ; female werewolves appear in the Irish work Tales of the Elders , from the 12th century; and Welsh werewolves in the 12th to 13th century work, Mabinogion .
Germanic pagan traditions associated with wolf-men persisted longest in the Scandinavian Viking Age . Harald I of Norway  is known to have had a body of Úlfhednar  (wolf-coated [men]), which are mentioned in the Vatnsdœla, Haraldskvæði, and the Völsunga saga , and resemble some werewolf legends. The Úlfhednar were fighters similar to the berserkers, though they dressed in wolf hides  rather than those of bears and were reputed to channel the spirits of these animals to enhance effectiveness in battle.[45] These warriors were resistant to pain and killed viciously in battle, much like wild animals. Úlfhednar and berserkers are closely associated with the Norse god Odin .
The Scandinavian traditions of this period may have spread to Kievan Rus' , giving rise to the Slavic "werewolf" tales. The 11th-century Belarusian  Prince Vseslav of Polotsk  was considered to have been a werewolf, capable of moving at superhuman speeds, as recounted in The Tale of Igor's Campaign :
Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan . The path of Great Sun, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed. For him in Polotsk they rang for matins early at St. Sophia the bells; but he heard the ringing in Kiev.
The situation as described during the medieval period gives rise to the dual form of werewolf folklore in Early Modern Europe. On one hand the "Germanic" werewolf, which becomes associated with the witchcraft panic , and on the other hand the "Slavic" werewolf or vlkolak , which becomes associated with the concept of the revenant  or "vampire". The "eastern" werewolf-vampire is found in the folklore of Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, Romania and the Balkans, while the "western" werewolf-sorcerer is found in France, German-speaking Europe and in the Baltic.
Being a werewolf was a common accusation in witch trials throughout their history, and it featured even in the Valais witch trials , one of the earliest such trials altogether, in the first half of the 15th century.[46]
In 1539, Martin Luther  used the form beerwolf  to describe a hypothetical ruler worse than a tyrant who must be resisted.[47]
In 'Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus ' (1555), Olaus Magnus  describes (Book 18, Chapter 45) an annual assembly of werewolves near the Lithuania-Courland border. The participants, including Lithuanian nobility and werewolves from the surrounding areas, gather to test their strength by attempting to jump over a castle wall's ruins. Those who succeed are regarded as strong, while weaker participants are punished with whippings.[48]
Early modern history
Further information: Werewolf witch trials  and Wolfssegen 
There were numerous reports of werewolf attacks – and consequent court trials – in 16th-century France. In some of the cases there was clear evidence against the accused of murder and cannibalism , but no association with wolves. In other cases people have been terrified by such creatures, such as that of Gilles Garnier  in Dole  in 1573, who was convicted of being a werewolf.[49]
A peak of attention to lycanthropy came in the late 16th to early 17th century, as part of the European witch-hunts .
A number of treatises on werewolves were written in France during 1595 and 1615. Werewolves were sighted in 1598 in Anjou , and a teenage werewolf was sentenced to life imprisonment in Bordeaux  in 1603. Henry Boguet  wrote a lengthy chapter about werewolves in 1602. In the Vaud, werewolves were convicted in 1602 and in 1624. A treatise by a Vaud pastor in 1653, however, argued that lycanthropy was purely an illusion. After this, the only further record from the Vaud dates to 1670: it is that of a boy who claimed he and his mother could change themselves into wolves, which was, however, not taken seriously. At the beginning of the 17th century witchcraft  was prosecuted by James I of England , who regarded "warwoolfes" as victims of delusion induced by "a natural superabundance of melancholic".[50]
After 1650, belief in lycanthropy had mostly disappeared from French-speaking Europe, as evidenced in Diderot's Encyclopedia , which attributed reports of lycanthropy to a "disorder of the brain".[51] Although there were continuing reports of extraordinary wolflike beasts, they were not considered to be werewolves. One such report concerned the Beast of Gévaudan , which terrorized the general area of the former province  of Gévaudan , now called Lozère , in south-central France; from the years 1764 to 1767, it killed upwards of 80 men, women, and children.
The part of Europe which showed more vigorous interest in werewolves after 1650 was the Holy Roman Empire . At least nine works on lycanthropy were printed in Germany between 1649 and 1679. In the Austrian and Bavarian Alps, belief in werewolves persisted well into the 18th century.[52] In any case, as late as in 1853, in Galicia , northwestern Spain, Manuel Blanco Romasanta  was judged and condemned as the author of a number of murders, but he claimed to be not guilty because of his condition of lobishome, werewolf.
Until the 20th century, wolf attacks on humans  were an occasional, but still widespread, feature of life in Europe.[53]
Some scholars have suggested that it was inevitable that wolves, being the most feared predators in Europe, were projected into the folklore of evil shapeshifters. This is said to be corroborated by the fact that areas devoid of wolves typically use different kinds of predator to fill the niche; werehyenas  in Africa, weretigers  in India,[45] as well as werepumas ("runa uturuncu")[54][55] and werejaguars ("yaguaraté-abá" or "tigre-capiango")[56][57] in southern South America.
An idea is explored in Sabine Baring-Gould 's work The Book of Werewolves is that werewolf legends may have been used to explain serial killings . Perhaps the most infamous example is the case of Peter Stumpp  (executed in 1589), the German farmer, and alleged serial killer and cannibal , also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.[58]
Asian cultures

Common Turkic folklore  holds a different, reverential light to the werewolf legends in that Turkic Central Asian shamans  after performing long and arduous rites would voluntarily be able to transform into the humanoid "Kurtadam" (literally meaning "Wolfman"). Since the wolf was the totemic ancestor animal of the Turkic peoples, they would be respectful of any shaman who was in such a form.

Lycanthropy as a medical condition
See also: Hypertrichosis  and Clinical lycanthropy 
Some modern researchers have tried to explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital  in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital porphyria , stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity , reddish teeth, and psychosis  could have been grounds for accusing a person of being a werewolf.[59] This is, however, argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims.[45] Others have pointed out the possibility of historical werewolves having been people with hypertrichosis , a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe.[45]
Woodward suggested rabies  as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies.[45] However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way is not part of the original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.[60]

Folk beliefs

Characteristics
The beliefs classed together under lycanthropy are far from uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his double  whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his soul , which goes forth seeking whomever it may devour, leaving its body in a state of trance ; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real animal or a familiar spirit , whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.
Werewolves were said in European folklore to bear tell-tale physical traits even in their human form. These included the meeting of both eyebrows  at the bridge of the nose, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. One method of identifying a werewolf in its human form was to cut the flesh of the accused, under the pretense that fur would be seen within the wound. A Russian superstition recalls a werewolf can be recognized by bristles under the tongue.[45]
The appearance of a werewolf in its animal form varies from culture to culture, though it is most commonly portrayed as being indistinguishable from ordinary wolves save for the fact that it has no tail (a trait thought characteristic of witches in animal form), is often larger, and retains human eyes and a voice. According to some Swedish accounts, the werewolf could be distinguished from a regular wolf by the fact that it would run on three legs, stretching the fourth one backwards to look like a tail.[61] After returning to their human forms, werewolves are usually documented as becoming weak, debilitated and undergoing painful nervous depression.[45]
One universally reviled trait in medieval Europe was the werewolf's habit of devouring recently buried corpses, a trait that is documented extensively, particularly in the Annales Medico-psychologiques in the 19th century.[45]
Becoming a werewolf
Various methods for becoming a werewolf have been reported, one of the simplest being the removal of clothing and putting on a belt made of wolfskin, probably as a substitute for the assumption of an entire animal skin (which also is frequently described).[62] In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic salve .[62] Drinking rainwater out of the footprint of the animal in question or from certain enchanted streams were also considered effectual modes of accomplishing metamorphosis.[63]
The 16th-century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus  says that the Livonian  werewolves were initiated by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his Songs of the Russian People gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, it was said that a man or woman could turn into a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.[45]
In other cases, the transformation was supposedly accomplished by Satanic  allegiance for the most loathsome ends, often for the sake of sating a craving for human flesh. "The werewolves", writes Richard Verstegan  (Restitution of Decayed Intelligence, 1628), are certayne sorcerers, who having annoynted their bodies with an ointment which they make by the instinct of the devil, and putting on a certayne inchaunted girdle, does not only unto the view of others seem as wolves, but to their own thinking have both the shape and nature of wolves, so long as they wear the said girdle. And they do dispose themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and most of humane creatures.
The phenomenon of repercussion, the power of animal metamorphosis , or of sending out a familiar , real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician , male and female, all the world over; and witch  superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the phenomenon of repercussion is asserted to manifest itself in connection with the bush-soul of the West African and the nagual  of Central America ; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the nagual with a human being are not termed lycanthropy.
The curse of lycanthropy was also considered by some scholars as being a divine punishment . Werewolf literature shows many examples of God  or saints  allegedly cursing those who invoked their wrath with lycanthropy. Such is the case of Lycaon , who was turned into a wolf by Zeus  as punishment for slaughtering one of his own sons and serving his remains to the gods as a dinner. Those who were excommunicated  by the Roman Catholic Church  were also said to become werewolves.[45]
The power of transforming others into wild beasts was attributed not only to malignant sorcerers, but to Christian saints  as well. Omnes angeli, boni et Mali, ex virtute naturali habent potestatem transmutandi corpora nostra ("All angels, good and bad , have the power of transmutating our bodies") was the dictum of St. Thomas Aquinas . St. Patrick  was said to have transformed the Welsh  King Vereticus into a wolf; Natalis  supposedly cursed an illustrious Irish family whose members were each doomed to be a wolf for seven years. In other tales the divine agency is even more direct, while in Russia, again, men supposedly became werewolves when incurring the wrath of the Devil.
A notable exception to the association of Lycanthropy and the Devil, comes from a rare and lesser known account of an 80-year-old man named Thiess . In 1692, in Jürgensburg , Livonia , Thiess testified under oath that he and other werewolves were the Hounds of God.[64]
He claimed they were warriors who descended into hell to battle witches and demons . Their efforts ensured that the Devil and his minions did not carry off the grain from local failed crops down to hell. Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for idolatry and superstitious belief .
Remedies
Various methods have existed for removing the werewolf form. In antiquity, the Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the power of exhaustion in curing people of lycanthropy. The victim would be subjected to long periods of physical activity in the hope of being purged of the malady. This practice stemmed from the fact that many alleged werewolves would be left feeling weak and debilitated after committing depredations.[45]
In medieval Europe, traditionally, there are three methods one can use to cure a victim of lycanthropy; medicinally (usually via the use of wolfsbane ), surgically, or by exorcism . However, many of the cures advocated by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal to the patients. A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured if one were to simply address it three times by its Christian name, while one Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it.[45] Conversion to Christianity is also a common method of removing lycanthropy in the medieval period; a devotion to St. Hubert  has also been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.
Connection to revenants
Further information: Revenant
vampire  was also linked to the werewolf in East European countries, particularly Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. In Serbia, the werewolf and vampire are known collectively as vulkodlak.[45]
Hungary and Balkans
In Hungarian  folklore, werewolves are said to live in the region of Transdanubia , and it was thought that the ability to change into a wolf was obtained in infancy, after suffering parental abuse or by a curse. It is told that at the age of seven the boy or the girl leave home at night to go hunting, and can change to a person or wolf whenever they want. The curse can also be obtained in adulthood if a person passes three times through an arch made of birch  with the help of a wild rose 's spine.
The werewolves were known to exterminate all kind of farm animals, especially sheep. The transformation usually occurred during the winter solstice , Easter  and a full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary were not only conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist documenting connections between the two.  Vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungarian folklore, both being feared in antiquity.[65]
Among the South Slavs , and also among the ethnic Kashubian people  in present-day northern Poland, there was the belief that if a child was born with hair, a birthmark, or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they wished, it was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.[66]
Serbian 
vukodlaks traditionally had the habit of congregating annually in the winter months, when they would strip off their wolf skins and hang them from trees. They would then get a hold of another vulkodlak's skin and burn it, releasing from its curse the vukodlak from whom the skin came.[45]
Caucasus
According to Armenian  lore, there are women who, in consequence of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form.[67] In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.
Americas and Caribbean

The Naskapis believed that the caribou  afterlife is guarded by giant wolves that kill careless hunters venturing too near. The Navajo people  feared witches in wolf's clothing called "Mai-cob".[68]
Woodward thought that these beliefs were due to the Norse colonization of the Americas .[45]
When the European colonization of the Americas  occurred, the pioneers brought their own werewolf folklore with them and were later influenced by the lore of their neighbouring colonies and those of the Natives. Belief in the loup-garou present in Canada  (thence Acadiana ), the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan ,[69] and upstate New York  originates from French folklore influenced by Native American stories on the Wendigo . In Mexico , there is a belief in a creature called the nagual . In Haiti , there is a superstition that werewolf spirits known locally as Jé-rouge (red eyes) can possess the bodies of unwitting persons and nightly transform them into cannibalistic lupine creatures. The Haitian jé-rouges typically try to trick mothers into giving away their children voluntarily by waking them at night and asking their permission to take their child, to which the disoriented mother may either reply yes or no. The Haitian jé-rouges differ from traditional European werewolves by their habit of actively trying to spread their lycanthropic condition to others, much like vampires.[45]

Werewolf Lore in Modern Times

In recent years, the concept of werewolves has seen a resurgence in popularity, particularly with the release of films and television series such as "The Wolf of Wall Street" (2013), "Teen Wolf" (TV series), and more recently, Netflix's "Wolves." This modern fascination can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Media Influence:** The portrayal of werewolves in popular media has evolved beyond the traditional horror genre into a more nuanced exploration of identity, transformation, and human nature.

2. **Cultural Relevance:** Werewolves often symbolize themes of primal instincts, societal constraints, and the struggle between humanity and animalistic urges. This resonates with modern audiences who are grappling with similar issues in their own lives.

3. **Literature and Fan Fiction:** The popularity of werewolf literature has surged due to fan fiction on platforms like Wattpad and Goodreads, where fans reimagine classic stories or create entirely new tales. These works often explore complex themes such as morality, transformation, and community.

4. **Psychological Interest:** There is a growing interest in psychology regarding the concept of identity transformation and how it affects human behavior. Werewolves embody this theme by representing an internal battle between two distinct personalities.

5. **Global Appeal:** The universal appeal of werewolf lore spans across cultures and languages, making it accessible to a broad audience worldwide. This cultural significance helps maintain its relevance in modern society.

### Conclusion

The enduring fascination with werewolves can be traced back through centuries of folklore and mythology but has been reinvigorated by contemporary media, literature, and cultural discussions. As technology continues to evolve and storytelling methods change, the allure of the werewolf is likely to persist, adapting to new contexts while retaining its core themes of transformation and human nature.

### Article: Werewolf Legends

Werewolf legends have fascinated humanity for centuries, with their origins rooted in ancient cultures and folklore traditions. These stories typically depict werewolves as supernatural beings that possess the ability to transform into human-like wolves or other animals during specific times of the year, most commonly when a full moon is present.

#### Origins of Werewolf Legends

Werewolf legends can be traced back to various civilizations across the world. Some of the earliest examples include:

- **Greek Mythology**: The concept of shape-shifting was well-known in ancient Greek culture, with figures such as Pan and Cerberus known for their ability to transform between human and animal forms.
- **Roman Mythology**: Similar to Greek mythology, Roman legends often featured beings capable of shifting forms. Examples include the Ceres, a deity associated with transformation and agriculture.
- **Native American Cultures**: Many indigenous tribes had stories about shape-shifters who could change into animals for various purposes, such as hunting or protection.

#### Cultural Significance

Werewolf legends hold significant cultural importance across different societies:

- **Symbolism of Transformation**: In many cultures, werewolves symbolize the duality of human nature and the cyclical changes that occur within individuals.
- **Cultural Identity**: These stories often reflect societal fears, desires, and values. They can serve as a means to explore complex themes such as morality, social order, and the struggle between good and evil.

#### Modern Interpretations

Today, werewolf legends continue to evolve and influence various forms of media:

- **Literature**: Classic works like "The Werewolf" by Edgar Allan Poe and more recent novels by authors such as Stephen King have explored the theme extensively.
- **Film and Television**: From early films like "Werewolf of London" (1935) to modern-day series like "True Blood," werewolves remain a popular subject in entertainment.
- **Video Games**: Werewolf-themed games often incorporate elements of strategy, survival, and exploration.

#### Scientific Perspective

From a scientific standpoint, the concept of werewolves challenges our understanding of biology and evolution. While there is no concrete evidence to support the existence of lycanthropy (the transformation into wolves), various biological factors have been proposed:

- **Psychological Factors**: Some theories suggest that exposure to stress or certain environmental toxins might lead to altered states of consciousness, potentially mimicking werewolf-like behavior.
- **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions can cause temporary changes in behavior and physical appearance. However, these are not typically associated with a full transformation into an animal.

#### Conclusion

Werewolf legends continue to captivate audiences worldwide due to their rich symbolism and enduring appeal. Whether viewed through the lens of ancient mythology or modern media, these stories remain a testament to humanity's fascination with the unknown and our innate desire to explore themes of transformation and duality.

Werewolf
In folklore , a werewolf[lower-alpha 1] (from
Old English
werwulf  'man-wolf'), or occasionally lycanthrope[lower-alpha 2] (from
Ancient Greek
λυκάνθρωπος , lykánthrōpos, 'wolf-human'), is an individual who can shape-shift  into a wolf  (or especially in modern film, a therianthropic
hybrid  wolf-like creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse  or affliction (often a bite or the occasional scratch from another werewolf), with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon .[lower-alpha 3] Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called lycanthropy,[lower-alpha 4] are Petronius  (27–66) and Gervase of Tilbury  (1150–1228).

Urban legend 
The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore , existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation  of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period . From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World  with colonialism . Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches , in the course of the Late Middle Ages  and the early modern period . Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland  (especially the Valais  and Vaud ) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.
The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the "witch-hunt " phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials.[lower-alpha 5] During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of Peter Stumpp  (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves , primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of wolf-charmers  recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia  and Styria .[lower-alpha 6]
After the end of the witch trials, the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies  and in the emerging Gothic horror  genre; werewolf fiction  as a genre has premodern precedents in medieval romances  (e.g., Bisclavret  and Guillaume de Palerme ) and developed in the 18th century out of the "semi-fictional" chapbook  tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern popular culture .

Names
The Modern English 
werewolf descends from the Old English 
wer(e)wulf, which is a cognate  of Middle Dutch 
weerwolf, Middle Low German 
warwulf, werwulf, Middle High German 
werwolf, and West Frisian 
waer-ûl(e).[1] These terms are generally derived from a Proto-Germanic  form reconstructed  as *wira-wulfaz ('man-wolf'), itself from an earlier Pre-Germanic  form *wiro-wulpos.[2][3][4] An alternative reconstruction, *wazi-wulfaz ('wolf-clothed'), would bring the Germanic compound  closer to the Slavic meaning,[2] with other semantic parallels in Old Norse 
úlfheðnar ('wolf-skinned') and úlfheðinn ('wolf-coat'), Old Irish 
luchthonn ('wolf-skin'), and Sanskrit 
Vṛkājina ('Wolf-skin').[5]
The Norse branch underwent taboo modifications , with Old Norse vargúlfr (only attested as a translation of Old French 
garwaf ~ garwal(f) from Marie's lay  of Bisclavret ) replacing *wiraz ('man') with vargr ('wolf, outlaw'), perhaps under the influence of the Old French expression leus warous ~ lous garous (modern loup-garou), which literally means 'wolf-werewolf'.[6][7] The modern Norse form varulv (Danish, Norwegian and Swedish) was either borrowed from Middle Low German werwulf,[7] or else derived from an unattested Old Norse *varulfr, posited as the regular descendant of Proto-Germanic *wira-wulfaz.[3] An Old Frankish  form *werwolf is inferred from the Middle Low German variant and was most likely borrowed into Old Norman 
garwa(l)f ~ garo(u)l, with regular Germanic –Romance  correspondence w- / g- (cf. William / Guillaume, Wales / Galles, etc.).[7][8]
The Proto-Slavic  noun *vьlko-dlakь, meaning "wolf-haired" (cf. *dlaka, "animal hair", "fur"),[2] can be reconstructed from Serbian vukòdlak, Slovenian 
vołkodlȃk, and Czech vlkodlak, although formal variations in Slavic languages  (*vьrdl(j)ak, *vьlkdolk, *vьlklak) and the late attestation of some forms pose difficulties in tracing the origin of the term.[9][10] The Greek
Vrykolakas  and Romanian 
Vîrcolac, designating vampire-like creatures in Balkan folklores, were borrowed from Slavic languages.[11][12] The same form is also found in other non-Slavic languages of the region, such as Albanian vurvolak and Turkish vurkolak.[12]
Bulgarian 
vьrkolak and Church Slavonic 
vurkolak may be interpreted as back-borrowings from Greek.[10] The name vurdalak  (вурдалак; 'ghoul, revenant') first appeared in Russian poet Alexander Pushkin 's work Pesni, published in 1835. The source of Pushkin's distinctive form remains debated in scholarship.[13][12]
A Proto-Celtic  noun *wiro-kū, meaning 'man-dog', has been reconstructed from Celtiberian 
uiroku, the Old Brittonic  place-name Viroconium  (Old Irish  noun ferchu ('male dog, fierce dog'), and the medieval personal names Guurci (Old Welsh ) and Gurki (Old Breton ). Wolves were metaphorically designated as 'dogs' in Celtic cultures.[14][4]
The modern term lycanthropy comes from Ancient Greek 
lukanthrōpía (λυκανθρωπία), itself from lukánthrōpos (λυκάνθρωπος), meaning 'wolf-man'. Ancient writers used the term solely in the context of clinical lycanthropy , a condition in which the patient imagined himself to be a wolf. Modern writers later used lycanthrope as a synonym of werewolf, referring to a person who, according to medieval superstition, could assume the form of wolves.[15]

History
Indo-European comparative mythology
The European motif of the devilish werewolf devouring human flesh harks back to a common development during the Middle Ages  in the context of Christianity, although stories of humans turning into wolves take their roots in earlier pre-Christian beliefs.[16][17]
Their underlying common origin can be traced back to Proto-Indo-European mythology , where lycanthropy is reconstructed as an aspect of the initiation of the kóryos  warrior class, which may have included a cult focused on dogs and wolves identified with an age grade of young, unmarried warriors.[4] The standard comparative overview of this aspect of Indo-European mythology is McCone (1987).[18]
Classical antiquity
Ancient Greek literature  and Folklore . Herodotus , in his Histories ,[19] wrote that according to what the Scythians and the Greeks settled in Scythia told him, the Neuri , which was a tribe to the north-east of Scythia , were all transformed into wolves once every year for several days and then changed back to their human shape. He added that he is not convinced by the story but the locals swear to its truth.[20] This tale was also mentioned by Pomponius Mela .[21]
In the second century BC, the Greek geographer Pausanias  related the story of King Lycaon  of Arcadia, who was transformed into a wolf because he had sacrificed a child in the altar of Zeus Lycaeus.[22] In the version of the legend told by Ovid  in his Metamorphoses ,[23] when Zeus  visits Lycaon disguised as a common man, Lycaon wants to test if he is really a god. To that end, he kills a Molossian hostage and serve his entrails to Zeus. Disgusted, the god turns Lycaon into a wolf. However, in other accounts of the legend, like that of Apollodorus'  Bibliotheca,[24] Zeus blasts him and his sons with thunderbolts as punishment.
Pausanias also relates the story of an Arcadian man called Damarchus  of Parrhasia, who was turned into a wolf after tasting the entrails of a human child sacrificed to Zeus  Lycaeus. He was restored to human form 10 years later and went on to become an Olympic champion.[25] This tale is also recounted by Pliny the Elder , who calls the man Demaenetus quoting Agriopas .[26] According to Pausanias, this was not a one-off event, but that men have been transformed into wolves during the sacrifices to Zeus Lycaeus since the time of Lycaon. If they abstain from tasting human flesh while being wolves, they would be restored to human form nine years later, but if they do not abstain, they would remain wolves forever.[22]
Lykos (Λύκος) of Athens was a wolf-shaped herο, whose shrine stood by the jurycourt, and the first jurors were named after him.[27]
Pliny the Elder likewise recounts another tale of lycanthropy. Quoting Euanthes,[28] he mentions that in Arcadia , once a year a man was chosen by lot from the Anthus' clan. The chosen man was escorted to a marsh in the area, where he hung his clothes into an oak  tree, swam across the marsh and transformed into a wolf, joining a pack  for nine years. If during these nine years he refrained from tasting human flesh, he returned to the same marsh, swam back, and recovered his previous human form, with nine years added to his appearance.[29] Ovid also relates stories of men who roamed the woods of Arcadia  in the form of wolves.[30][31]
Virgil , in his poetic work Eclogues , wrote about a man called Moeris, who used herbs and poisons picked in his native Pontus  to turn himself into a wolf.[32] In prose , the Satyricon , written circa AD 60 by Gaius Petronius Arbiter , one of the characters, Niceros, tells a story at a banquet about a friend who turned into a wolf (chs. 61–62). He describes the incident as follows, "When I look for my buddy I see he'd stripped and piled his clothes by the roadside... He pees in a circle round his clothes and then, just like that, turns into a wolf!... after he turned into a wolf he started howling and then ran off into the woods."[33]
Early Christian authors also mentioned werewolves. In The City of God, Augustine of Hippo  gives an account similar to that found in Pliny the Elder. Augustine explains that "It is very generally believed that by certain witches spells men may be turned into wolves..."[34] Physical metamorphosis was also mentioned in the Capitulatum Episcopi, attributed to the Council of Ancyra  in the 4th century, which became the Church's doctrinal text in relation to magic, witches, and transformations such as those of werewolves.[35] The Capitulatum Episcopi states that "Whoever believes that anything can be...transformed into another species or likeness, except by God Himself...is beyond doubt an infidel.'[35]
In these works of Roman writers, werewolves often receive the name versipellis ("turnskin"). Augustine instead uses the phrase "in lupum fuisse mutatum" (changed into the form of a wolf) to describe the physical metamorphosis of werewolves, which is similar to phrases used in the medieval period.
Middle Ages
There is evidence of widespread belief in werewolves in medieval Europe. This evidence spans much of the Continent, as well as the British Isles. Werewolves were mentioned in Medieval law codes, such as that of King Cnut , whose Ecclesiastical Ordinances inform us that the codes aim to ensure that "...the madly audacious werewolf do not too widely devastate, nor bite too many of the spiritual flock."[36]
Liutprand of Cremona  reports a rumor that Bajan, son of Simeon I of Bulgaria , could use magic to turn himself into a wolf.[37] The works of Augustine of Hippo had a large influence on the development of Western Christianity, and were widely read by churchmen of the medieval period; and these churchmen occasionally discussed werewolves in their works. Famous examples include Gerald of Wales 's Werewolves of Ossory , found in his Topographica Hibernica, and in Gervase of Tilbury's
Otia Imperiala , both written for royal audiences.
Gervase reveals to the reader that belief in such transformations (he also mentions women turning into cats and into snakes) was widespread across Europe; he uses the phrase "que ita dinoscuntur" when discussing these metamorphoses, which translates to "it is known". Gervase, who was writing in Germany, also tells the reader that the transformation of men into wolves cannot be easily dismissed, for "...in England we have often seen men change into wolves" ("Vidimus enim frequenter in Anglia per lunationes homines in lupos mutari...").[38] Further evidence of the widespread belief in werewolves and other human-animal transformations can be seen in theological attacks made against such beliefs. Conrad of Hirsau , writing in the 11th century, forbids the reading of stories in which a person's reason is obscured following such a transformation.[39] Conrad specifically refers to the tales of Ovid in his tract. Pseudo-Augustine, writing in the 12th century, follows Augustine of Hippo's argument that no physical transformation can be made by any but God, stating that "...the body corporeally [cannot], be changed into the material limbs of any animal.'[40]
Marie de France 's poem Bisclavret  (c. 1200) is another example, in which the eponymous nobleman Bisclavret, for reasons not described, had to transform into a wolf every week. When his treacherous wife stole his clothing needed to restore his human form, he escaped the king's wolf hunt by imploring the king for mercy and accompanied the king thereafter. His behavior at court was gentle, until his wife and her new husband appeared at court, so much so that his hateful attack on the couple was deemed justly motivated, and the truth was revealed. This lai  (a type of Breton sung-poem) follows many themes found within other werewolf tales – the removal of clothing and attempting to refrain from the consumption of human flesh can be found in Pliny the Elder, as well as in the second of Gervase of Tilbury's werewolf stories, about a werewolf by the name of Chaucevaire. Marie also reveals to us the existence of werewolf belief in Breton and Norman France, by telling us the Franco-Norman word for werewolf: garwulf, which, she explains, are common in that part of France, where "...many men turned into werewolves".[41] Gervase also supports this terminology when he tells us that the French use the term "gerulfi" to describe what the English call "werewolves".[42]
Melion  and Biclarel are two anonymous lais that share the theme of a werewolf knight being betrayed by his wife.[43]
The German word werwolf was recorded by Burchard von Worms  in the 11th century and Bertold of Regensburg  in the 13th century but is not recorded in all of medieval German poetry or fiction. While Baring-Gould argues that references to werewolves were also rare in England, presumably because whatever significance the "wolf-men" of Germanic paganism had carried, the associated beliefs and practices had been successfully repressed after Christianization (or if they persisted, they did so outside of the sphere of literacy available to us), we have sources other than those mentioned above.[44] Such examples of werewolves in Ireland and the British Isles can be found in the work of the 9th century Welsh monk Nennius ; female werewolves appear in the Irish work Tales of the Elders , from the 12th century; and Welsh werewolves in the 12th to 13th century work, Mabinogion .
Germanic pagan traditions associated with wolf-men persisted longest in the Scandinavian Viking Age . Harald I of Norway  is known to have had a body of Úlfhednar  (wolf-coated [men]), which are mentioned in the Vatnsdœla, Haraldskvæði, and the Völsunga saga , and resemble some werewolf legends. The Úlfhednar were fighters similar to the berserkers, though they dressed in wolf hides  rather than those of bears and were reputed to channel the spirits of these animals to enhance effectiveness in battle.[45] These warriors were resistant to pain and killed viciously in battle, much like wild animals. Úlfhednar and berserkers are closely associated with the Norse god Odin .
The Scandinavian traditions of this period may have spread to Kievan Rus' , giving rise to the Slavic "werewolf" tales. The 11th-century Belarusian  Prince Vseslav of Polotsk  was considered to have been a werewolf, capable of moving at superhuman speeds, as recounted in The Tale of Igor's Campaign :
Vseslav the prince judged men; as prince, he ruled towns; but at night he prowled in the guise of a wolf. From Kiev, prowling, he reached, before the cocks crew, Tmutorokan . The path of Great Sun, as a wolf, prowling, he crossed. For him in Polotsk they rang for matins early at St. Sophia the bells; but he heard the ringing in Kiev.
The situation as described during the medieval period gives rise to the dual form of werewolf folklore in Early Modern Europe. On one hand the "Germanic" werewolf, which becomes associated with the witchcraft panic , and on the other hand the "Slavic" werewolf or vlkolak , which becomes associated with the concept of the revenant  or "vampire". The "eastern" werewolf-vampire is found in the folklore of Central and Eastern Europe, including Hungary, Romania and the Balkans, while the "western" werewolf-sorcerer is found in France, German-speaking Europe and in the Baltic.
Being a werewolf was a common accusation in witch trials throughout their history, and it featured even in the Valais witch trials , one of the earliest such trials altogether, in the first half of the 15th century.[46]
In 1539, Martin Luther  used the form beerwolf  to describe a hypothetical ruler worse than a tyrant who must be resisted.[47]
In 'Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus ' (1555), Olaus Magnus  describes (Book 18, Chapter 45) an annual assembly of werewolves near the Lithuania-Courland border. The participants, including Lithuanian nobility and werewolves from the surrounding areas, gather to test their strength by attempting to jump over a castle wall's ruins. Those who succeed are regarded as strong, while weaker participants are punished with whippings.[48]
Early modern history
Further information: Werewolf witch trials  and Wolfssegen 
There were numerous reports of werewolf attacks – and consequent court trials – in 16th-century France. In some of the cases there was clear evidence against the accused of murder and cannibalism , but no association with wolves. In other cases people have been terrified by such creatures, such as that of Gilles Garnier  in Dole  in 1573, who was convicted of being a werewolf.[49]
A peak of attention to lycanthropy came in the late 16th to early 17th century, as part of the European witch-hunts .
A number of treatises on werewolves were written in France during 1595 and 1615. Werewolves were sighted in 1598 in Anjou , and a teenage werewolf was sentenced to life imprisonment in Bordeaux  in 1603. Henry Boguet  wrote a lengthy chapter about werewolves in 1602. In the Vaud, werewolves were convicted in 1602 and in 1624. A treatise by a Vaud pastor in 1653, however, argued that lycanthropy was purely an illusion. After this, the only further record from the Vaud dates to 1670: it is that of a boy who claimed he and his mother could change themselves into wolves, which was, however, not taken seriously. At the beginning of the 17th century witchcraft  was prosecuted by James I of England , who regarded "warwoolfes" as victims of delusion induced by "a natural superabundance of melancholic".[50]
After 1650, belief in lycanthropy had mostly disappeared from French-speaking Europe, as evidenced in Diderot's Encyclopedia , which attributed reports of lycanthropy to a "disorder of the brain".[51] Although there were continuing reports of extraordinary wolflike beasts, they were not considered to be werewolves. One such report concerned the Beast of Gévaudan , which terrorized the general area of the former province  of Gévaudan , now called Lozère , in south-central France; from the years 1764 to 1767, it killed upwards of 80 men, women, and children.
The part of Europe which showed more vigorous interest in werewolves after 1650 was the Holy Roman Empire . At least nine works on lycanthropy were printed in Germany between 1649 and 1679. In the Austrian and Bavarian Alps, belief in werewolves persisted well into the 18th century.[52] In any case, as late as in 1853, in Galicia , northwestern Spain, Manuel Blanco Romasanta  was judged and condemned as the author of a number of murders, but he claimed to be not guilty because of his condition of lobishome, werewolf.
Until the 20th century, wolf attacks on humans  were an occasional, but still widespread, feature of life in Europe.[53]
Some scholars have suggested that it was inevitable that wolves, being the most feared predators in Europe, were projected into the folklore of evil shapeshifters. This is said to be corroborated by the fact that areas devoid of wolves typically use different kinds of predator to fill the niche; werehyenas  in Africa, weretigers  in India,[45] as well as werepumas ("runa uturuncu")[54][55] and werejaguars ("yaguaraté-abá" or "tigre-capiango")[56][57] in southern South America.
An idea is explored in Sabine Baring-Gould 's work The Book of Werewolves is that werewolf legends may have been used to explain serial killings . Perhaps the most infamous example is the case of Peter Stumpp  (executed in 1589), the German farmer, and alleged serial killer and cannibal , also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg.[58]
Asian cultures

Common Turkic folklore  holds a different, reverential light to the werewolf legends in that Turkic Central Asian shamans  after performing long and arduous rites would voluntarily be able to transform into the humanoid "Kurtadam" (literally meaning "Wolfman"). Since the wolf was the totemic ancestor animal of the Turkic peoples, they would be respectful of any shaman who was in such a form.

Lycanthropy as a medical condition
See also: Hypertrichosis  and Clinical lycanthropy 
Some modern researchers have tried to explain the reports of werewolf behaviour with recognised medical conditions. Dr Lee Illis of Guy's Hospital  in London wrote a paper in 1963 entitled On Porphyria and the Aetiology of Werewolves in which he argues that historical accounts on werewolves could have in fact been referring to victims of congenital porphyria , stating how the symptoms of photosensitivity , reddish teeth, and psychosis  could have been grounds for accusing a person of being a werewolf.[59] This is, however, argued against by Woodward, who points out how mythological werewolves were almost invariably portrayed as resembling true wolves and that their human forms were rarely physically conspicuous as porphyria victims.[45] Others have pointed out the possibility of historical werewolves having been people with hypertrichosis , a hereditary condition manifesting itself in excessive hair growth. However, Woodward dismissed the possibility, as the rarity of the disease ruled it out from happening on a large scale as werewolf cases were in medieval Europe.[45]
Woodward suggested rabies  as the origin of werewolf beliefs, claiming remarkable similarities between the symptoms of that disease and some of the legends. Woodward focused on the idea that being bitten by a werewolf could result in the victim turning into one, which suggested the idea of a transmittable disease like rabies.[45] However, the idea that lycanthropy could be transmitted in this way is not part of the original myths and legends and only appears in relatively recent beliefs. Lycanthropy can also be met with as the main content of a delusion, for example, the case of a woman has been reported who during episodes of acute psychosis complained of becoming four different species of animals.[60]

Folk beliefs

Characteristics
The beliefs classed together under lycanthropy are far from uniform, and the term is somewhat capriciously applied. The transformation may be temporary or permanent; the were-animal may be the man himself metamorphosed; may be his double  whose activity leaves the real man to all appearance unchanged; may be his soul , which goes forth seeking whomever it may devour, leaving its body in a state of trance ; or it may be no more than the messenger of the human being, a real animal or a familiar spirit , whose intimate connection with its owner is shown by the fact that any injury to it is believed, by a phenomenon known as repercussion, to cause a corresponding injury to the human being.
Werewolves were said in European folklore to bear tell-tale physical traits even in their human form. These included the meeting of both eyebrows  at the bridge of the nose, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. One method of identifying a werewolf in its human form was to cut the flesh of the accused, under the pretense that fur would be seen within the wound. A Russian superstition recalls a werewolf can be recognized by bristles under the tongue.[45]
The appearance of a werewolf in its animal form varies from culture to culture, though it is most commonly portrayed as being indistinguishable from ordinary wolves save for the fact that it has no tail (a trait thought characteristic of witches in animal form), is often larger, and retains human eyes and a voice. According to some Swedish accounts, the werewolf could be distinguished from a regular wolf by the fact that it would run on three legs, stretching the fourth one backwards to look like a tail.[61] After returning to their human forms, werewolves are usually documented as becoming weak, debilitated and undergoing painful nervous depression.[45]
One universally reviled trait in medieval Europe was the werewolf's habit of devouring recently buried corpses, a trait that is documented extensively, particularly in the Annales Medico-psychologiques in the 19th century.[45]
Becoming a werewolf
Various methods for becoming a werewolf have been reported, one of the simplest being the removal of clothing and putting on a belt made of wolfskin, probably as a substitute for the assumption of an entire animal skin (which also is frequently described).[62] In other cases, the body is rubbed with a magic salve .[62] Drinking rainwater out of the footprint of the animal in question or from certain enchanted streams were also considered effectual modes of accomplishing metamorphosis.[63]
The 16th-century Swedish writer Olaus Magnus  says that the Livonian  werewolves were initiated by draining a cup of specially prepared beer and repeating a set formula. Ralston in his Songs of the Russian People gives the form of incantation still familiar in Russia. In Italy, France and Germany, it was said that a man or woman could turn into a werewolf if he or she, on a certain Wednesday or Friday, slept outside on a summer night with the full moon shining directly on his or her face.[45]
In other cases, the transformation was supposedly accomplished by Satanic  allegiance for the most loathsome ends, often for the sake of sating a craving for human flesh. "The werewolves", writes Richard Verstegan  (Restitution of Decayed Intelligence, 1628), are certayne sorcerers, who having annoynted their bodies with an ointment which they make by the instinct of the devil, and putting on a certayne inchaunted girdle, does not only unto the view of others seem as wolves, but to their own thinking have both the shape and nature of wolves, so long as they wear the said girdle. And they do dispose themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and most of humane creatures.
The phenomenon of repercussion, the power of animal metamorphosis , or of sending out a familiar , real or spiritual, as a messenger, and the supernormal powers conferred by association with such a familiar, are also attributed to the magician , male and female, all the world over; and witch  superstitions are closely parallel to, if not identical with, lycanthropic beliefs, the occasional involuntary character of lycanthropy being almost the sole distinguishing feature. In another direction the phenomenon of repercussion is asserted to manifest itself in connection with the bush-soul of the West African and the nagual  of Central America ; but though there is no line of demarcation to be drawn on logical grounds, the assumed power of the magician and the intimate association of the bush-soul or the nagual with a human being are not termed lycanthropy.
The curse of lycanthropy was also considered by some scholars as being a divine punishment . Werewolf literature shows many examples of God  or saints  allegedly cursing those who invoked their wrath with lycanthropy. Such is the case of Lycaon , who was turned into a wolf by Zeus  as punishment for slaughtering one of his own sons and serving his remains to the gods as a dinner. Those who were excommunicated  by the Roman Catholic Church  were also said to become werewolves.[45]
The power of transforming others into wild beasts was attributed not only to malignant sorcerers, but to Christian saints  as well. Omnes angeli, boni et Mali, ex virtute naturali habent potestatem transmutandi corpora nostra ("All angels, good and bad , have the power of transmutating our bodies") was the dictum of St. Thomas Aquinas . St. Patrick  was said to have transformed the Welsh  King Vereticus into a wolf; Natalis  supposedly cursed an illustrious Irish family whose members were each doomed to be a wolf for seven years. In other tales the divine agency is even more direct, while in Russia, again, men supposedly became werewolves when incurring the wrath of the Devil.
A notable exception to the association of Lycanthropy and the Devil, comes from a rare and lesser known account of an 80-year-old man named Thiess . In 1692, in Jürgensburg , Livonia , Thiess testified under oath that he and other werewolves were the Hounds of God.[64]
He claimed they were warriors who descended into hell to battle witches and demons . Their efforts ensured that the Devil and his minions did not carry off the grain from local failed crops down to hell. Thiess was ultimately sentenced to ten lashes for idolatry and superstitious belief .
Remedies
Various methods have existed for removing the werewolf form. In antiquity, the Ancient Greeks and Romans believed in the power of exhaustion in curing people of lycanthropy. The victim would be subjected to long periods of physical activity in the hope of being purged of the malady. This practice stemmed from the fact that many alleged werewolves would be left feeling weak and debilitated after committing depredations.[45]
In medieval Europe, traditionally, there are three methods one can use to cure a victim of lycanthropy; medicinally (usually via the use of wolfsbane ), surgically, or by exorcism . However, many of the cures advocated by medieval medical practitioners proved fatal to the patients. A Sicilian belief of Arabic origin holds that a werewolf can be cured of its ailment by striking it on the forehead or scalp with a knife. Another belief from the same culture involves the piercing of the werewolf's hands with nails. Sometimes, less extreme methods were used. In the German lowland of Schleswig-Holstein, a werewolf could be cured if one were to simply address it three times by its Christian name, while one Danish belief holds that merely scolding a werewolf will cure it.[45] Conversion to Christianity is also a common method of removing lycanthropy in the medieval period; a devotion to St. Hubert  has also been cited as both cure for and protection from lycanthropes.
Connection to revenants
Further information: Revenant
vampire  was also linked to the werewolf in East European countries, particularly Bulgaria, Serbia and Slovenia. In Serbia, the werewolf and vampire are known collectively as vulkodlak.[45]
Hungary and Balkans
In Hungarian  folklore, werewolves are said to live in the region of Transdanubia , and it was thought that the ability to change into a wolf was obtained in infancy, after suffering parental abuse or by a curse. It is told that at the age of seven the boy or the girl leave home at night to go hunting, and can change to a person or wolf whenever they want. The curse can also be obtained in adulthood if a person passes three times through an arch made of birch  with the help of a wild rose 's spine.
The werewolves were known to exterminate all kind of farm animals, especially sheep. The transformation usually occurred during the winter solstice , Easter  and a full moon. Later in the 17th and 18th century, the trials in Hungary were not only conducted against witches, but against werewolves too, and many records exist documenting connections between the two.  Vampires and werewolves are closely related in Hungarian folklore, both being feared in antiquity.[65]
Among the South Slavs , and also among the ethnic Kashubian people  in present-day northern Poland, there was the belief that if a child was born with hair, a birthmark, or a caul on their head, they were supposed to possess shape-shifting abilities. Though capable of turning into any animal they wished, it was commonly believed that such people preferred to turn into a wolf.[66]
Serbian 
vukodlaks traditionally had the habit of congregating annually in the winter months, when they would strip off their wolf skins and hang them from trees. They would then get a hold of another vulkodlak's skin and burn it, releasing from its curse the vukodlak from whom the skin came.[45]
Caucasus
According to Armenian  lore, there are women who, in consequence of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form.[67] In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With her better nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.
Americas and Caribbean

The Naskapis believed that the caribou  afterlife is guarded by giant wolves that kill careless hunters venturing too near. The Navajo people  feared witches in wolf's clothing called "Mai-cob".[68]
Woodward thought that these beliefs were due to the Norse colonization of the Americas .[45]
When the European colonization of the Americas  occurred, the pioneers brought their own werewolf folklore with them and were later influenced by the lore of their neighbouring colonies and those of the Natives. Belief in the loup-garou present in Canada  (thence Acadiana ), the Upper and Lower Peninsulas of Michigan ,[69] and upstate New York  originates from French folklore influenced by Native American stories on the Wendigo . In Mexico , there is a belief in a creature called the nagual . In Haiti , there is a superstition that werewolf spirits known locally as Jé-rouge (red eyes) can possess the bodies of unwitting persons and nightly transform them into cannibalistic lupine creatures. The Haitian jé-rouges typically try to trick mothers into giving away their children voluntarily by waking them at night and asking their permission to take their child, to which the disoriented mother may either reply yes or no. The Haitian jé-rouges differ from traditional European werewolves by their habit of actively trying to spread their lycanthropic condition to others, much like vampires.[45]

Modern reception
Werewolf fiction
Main article: Werewolf fiction 
Most modern fiction describes werewolves as vulnerable to silver  weapons and highly resistant to other injuries. This feature appears in German folklore of the 19th century.[70] The claim that the Beast of Gévaudan , an 18th-century wolf or wolflike creature, was shot by a silver bullet appears to have been introduced by novelists retelling the story from 1935 onwards and not in earlier versions.[71][72][73] English folklore, prior to 1865, showed shapeshifters to be vulnerable to silver. "...till the publican shot a silver button over their heads when they were instantly transformed into two ill-favoured old ladies..."[74] c. 1640 the city of Greifswald, Germany was infested by werewolves. "A clever lad suggested that they gather all their silver buttons, goblets, belt buckles, and so forth, and melt them down into bullets for their muskets and pistols. ... this time they slaughtered the creatures and rid Greifswald of the lycanthropes."[75]
The 1897 novel Dracula  and the short story "Dracula's Guest ", both written by Bram Stoker , drew on earlier mythologies of werewolves and similar legendary demons and "was to voice the anxieties of an age", and the "fears of late Victorian
patriarchy ".[76] In "Dracula's Guest", a band of military horsemen coming to the aid of the protagonist chase off Dracula, depicted as a great wolf stating the only way to kill it is by a "Sacred Bullet".[77] This is also mentioned in the main novel Dracula as well. Count Dracula  stated in the novel that legends of werewolves originated from his Szekely  racial bloodline,[78] who himself is also depicted with the ability to shapeshift  into a wolf at will during the night but is unable to do so during the day except at noon.[79]
The 1928 novel The Wolf's Bride: A Tale from Estonia, written by the Finnish  author Aino Kallas , tells story of the forester Priidik's wife Aalo living in Hiiumaa  in the 17th century, who became a werewolf under the influence of a malevolent forest spirit, also known as Diabolus Sylvarum.[80]
The first feature film to use an anthropomorphic  werewolf was Werewolf of London  in 1935. The main werewolf of this film is a dapper London scientist who retains some of his style and most of his human features after his transformation,[81] as lead actor Henry Hull  was unwilling to spend long hours being made up by makeup artist Jack Pierce .[82]
Universal Studios  drew on a Balkan tale of a plant associated with lycanthropy as there was no literary work to draw upon, unlike the case with vampires. There is no reference to silver nor other aspects of werewolf lore such as cannibalism.[83]
A more tragic character is Lawrence Talbot , played by Lon Chaney Jr.  in 1941's The Wolf Man . With Pierce's makeup more elaborate this time,[84] the movie catapulted the werewolf into public consciousness.[81] Sympathetic portrayals are few but notable, such as the comedic but tortured protagonist David Naughton  in An American Werewolf in London ,[85] and a less anguished and more confident and charismatic Jack Nicholson  in the 1994 film Wolf .[86] Over time, the depiction of werewolves has gone from fully malevolent to even heroic creatures, such as in the Underworld  and Twilight  series, as well as Blood Lad , Dance in the Vampire Bund , Rosario + Vampire , and various other movies, anime , manga , and comic books .
Other werewolves are decidedly more willful and malevolent, such as those in the novel The Howling  and its subsequent sequels and film adaptations . The form a werewolf assumes was generally anthropomorphic in early films such as The Wolf Man and Werewolf of London, but a larger and powerful wolf in many later films.[87]
Werewolves are often depicted as immune to damage caused by ordinary weapons, being vulnerable only to silver  objects, such as a silver-tipped cane, bullet  or blade ; this attribute was first adopted cinematically in The Wolf Man.[84] This negative reaction to silver is sometimes so strong that the mere touch of the metal on a werewolf's skin will cause burns. Current-day werewolf fiction almost exclusively involves lycanthropy being either a hereditary condition or transmitted like an infectious disease  by the bite of another werewolf. In some fiction, the power of the werewolf extends to human form, such as invulnerability to conventional injury due to their healing factor, superhuman speed and strength, and falling on their feet from high falls. Also, aggressiveness and animalistic urges may be intensified and more difficult to control (hunger, sexual arousal). Usually in these cases, the abilities are diminished in human form. In other fiction, it can be cured by medicine men or antidotes.
Along with the vulnerability to the silver bullet, the full moon being the cause of the transformation only became part of the depiction of werewolves on a widespread basis in the twentieth century.[88] The first movie to feature the transformative effect of the full moon was Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man  in 1943.[89]
Werewolves are typically envisioned as "working-class" monsters, often being low in socio-economic status, although they can represent a variety of social classes and at times were seen as a way of representing "aristocratic decadence" during 19th century horror literature.[90][91][92]
Nazi Germany
Nazi Germany used Werwolf, as the mythical creature's name is spelled in German, in 1942–43 as the codename for one of Hitler's headquarters . In the war's final days, the Nazi "Operation Werwolf " aimed at creating a commando force that would operate behind enemy lines as the Allies advanced through Germany itself.
Two fictional depictions of "Operation Werwolf" –
the US television series True Blood  and the 2012 novel Wolf Hunter by J. L. Benét –
mix the two meanings of "Werwolf" by depicting the 1945 die-hard Nazi commandos as being actual werewolves.[93]

Lorey (2000) records 280 known cases; this contrasts with a total number of 12,000 recorded cases of executions for witchcraft, or an estimated grand total of about 60,000, corresponding to 2% or 0.5% respectively. The recorded cases span the period of 1407 to 1725, peaking during the period of 1575–1657.
Lorey (2000) records six trials in the period 1701 and 1725, all in either Styria or Carinthia; 1701 Paul Perwolf of Wolfsburg, Obdach, Styria (executed); 1705 "Vlastl" of Murau, Styria (verdict unknown); 1705/6 six beggars in Wolfsberg, Carinthia (executed); 1707/8 three shepherds in Leoben and Freyenstein, Styria (one lynching, two probable executions); 1718 Jakob Kranawitter, a mentally disabled beggar, in Rotenfel, Oberwolz, Styria (corporeal punishment); 1725: Paul Schäffer, beggar of St. Leonhard im Lavanttal, Carinthia (executed).

Malay folklore that appear as written traditions are often called hikayat, kisah or dongeng. The oldest of them were written in Old Malay using the prevailing scripts of the time, such as Sanskrit, Pallava or Kawi . From around the 14th century onward, they were written in Classical Malay using Jawi script which prevailed ever since the arrival of Islam until the colonial era. During this time, the Malay royal courts became the centre for learning where scribes record the genealogy of kings and queens as well as historical events.

The hikayat or epics are collections of stories and legends of heroism that often involve mythological and historical figures in a setting usually engaging the role of protagonists and antagonists. The Hikayat Hang Tuah, for example, is one of the most well known hikayat which are often told and retold in various forms such as children's books, films, theatre plays and musical productions.

Other notable hikayat include: 

Hikayat Abdullah
Hikayat Amir Hamzah or Hikayat Hamzah

Hikayat Andaken Penurat

Hikayat Anggun Che’ Tunggal

Hikayat Bayan Budiman  

Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati  
Hikayat Inderajaya

Hikayat Inderaputera 

Hikayat Iskandar

Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain

Hikayat Isma Yatim

Hikayat Malim Deman

Fairy tales (kisah dongeng)

In this category, the story of Puteri Gunung Ledang , Bawang Putih Bawang Merah  and Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup is well known by the Malays. All three have been made into movies, albeit with differing interpretations and settings.

Orang Bunian: a race of exceptional beauty and grace.
Orang ketot: humans with short stature, similar to dwarves
Orang kenit: small humans, often possessing magic powers
Gergasi: giants or ogres

Werewolf
In folklore , a werewolf[lower-alpha 1] (from
Old English
werwulf  'man-wolf'), or occasionally lycanthrope[lower-alpha 2] (from
Ancient Greek
λυκάνθρωπος , lykánthrōpos, 'wolf-human'), is an individual who can shape-shift  into a wolf  (or especially in modern film, a therianthropic
hybrid  wolf-like creature), either purposely or after being placed under a curse  or affliction (often a bite or the occasional scratch from another werewolf), with the transformations occurring on the night of a full moon .[lower-alpha 3] Early sources for belief in this ability or affliction, called lycanthropy,[lower-alpha 4] are Petronius  (27–66) and Gervase of Tilbury  (1150–1228).

The werewolf is a widespread concept in European folklore , existing in many variants, which are related by a common development of a Christian interpretation  of underlying European folklore developed during the medieval period . From the early modern period, werewolf beliefs also spread to the New World  with colonialism . Belief in werewolves developed in parallel to the belief in witches , in the course of the Late Middle Ages  and the early modern period . Like the witchcraft trials as a whole, the trial of supposed werewolves emerged in what is now Switzerland  (especially the Valais  and Vaud ) in the early 15th century and spread throughout Europe in the 16th, peaking in the 17th and subsiding by the 18th century.
The persecution of werewolves and the associated folklore is an integral part of the "witch-hunt " phenomenon, albeit a marginal one, accusations of lycanthropy being involved in only a small fraction of witchcraft trials.[lower-alpha 5] During the early period, accusations of lycanthropy (transformation into a wolf) were mixed with accusations of wolf-riding or wolf-charming. The case of Peter Stumpp  (1589) led to a significant peak in both interest in and persecution of supposed werewolves , primarily in French-speaking and German-speaking Europe. The phenomenon persisted longest in Bavaria and Austria, with persecution of wolf-charmers  recorded until well after 1650, the final cases taking place in the early 18th century in Carinthia  and Styria .[lower-alpha 6]
After the end of the witch trials, the werewolf became of interest in folklore studies  and in the emerging Gothic horror  genre; werewolf fiction  as a genre has premodern precedents in medieval romances  (e.g., Bisclavret  and Guillaume de Palerme ) and developed in the 18th century out of the "semi-fictional" chapbook  tradition. The trappings of horror literature in the 20th century became part of the horror and fantasy genre of modern popular culture .


###Article: Middle Ages
Middle Ages
In the history of Europe , the Middle Ages or medieval period (also spelt mediaeval or mediæval) lasted from approximately 500 to 1500 AD. It is the second of the three traditional divisions of Western history: antiquity , medieval, and modern . Major developments include the economic predominance of agriculture, exploitation of the peasantry, slow inter-regional communication, the importance of personal relationships  in power structures, and the weakness of state administration. The period is sometimes subdivided into the Early , High , and Late Middle Ages , and the early medieval period is alternatively referred to as the Dark Ages .
This article is about medieval Europe. For a global history of the period between the 5th and 15th centuries, see Post-classical history . For other uses, see Middle Ages (disambiguation) .
Population decline , counterurbanisation , the collapse of centralised authority, the mass migration of tribes  (mainly Germanic peoples ), and Christianisation , which had begun in late antiquity , continued into the Early Middle Ages. The movement of peoples led to the disintegration  of the Western Roman Empire  and the rise of new kingdoms . In the post-Roman world, taxation declined, the army was financed through land grants, and the blending of Later Roman  civilisation and the invaders' traditions is well documented. The Eastern Roman Empire  (or Byzantine Empire) survived, but lost the Middle East  and North Africa  to Muslim conquerors  in the 7th century. Although the Carolingian dynasty  of the Franks  reunited many of the Western Roman lands by the early 9th century, the Carolingian Empire  quickly fell apart into competing kingdoms which later fragmented into autonomous duchies and lordships.
During the High Middle Ages, which began after 1000, the population of Europe increased greatly as the Medieval Warm Period  allowed crop yields to increase, and technological and agricultural innovations  introduced a "commercial revolution ". Slavery  nearly disappeared, and peasants could improve their status by colonising  faraway regions in return for economic and legal concessions. New towns developed from local commercial centers, and urban artisans united into local guilds  to protect their common interests. Western church leaders accepted papal supremacy  to get rid  of lay  influence, which accelerated the separation of the western Catholic  and eastern Orthodox Churches  and triggered the Investiture Controversy  between the papacy  and secular powers. With the spread of heavy cavalry , a new aristocracy stabilised their position through strict inheritance customs. In the system of feudalism , noble knights  owed military service to their lords in return for the lands they had received in fief . Stone castles were built  in regions where central authority was weak, but state power was on the rise by the end of the period. The settlement of Western European peasants and aristocrats towards the eastern and southern peripheries of Europe, often spurred by crusades , led to the expansion of Latin Christendom . The spread of cathedral schools  and universities  stimulated a new method of intellectual discussion, with an emphasis on rational argumentation known as scholasticism . Mass pilgrimages  prompted the construction of massive Romanesque  churches, while structural innovations led to the development of the more delicate Gothic architecture .
Calamities which included a great famine  and the Black Death , which reduced the population by 50 per cent, began the Late Middle Ages in the 14th century. Conflicts between ethnic and social groups intensified  and local conflicts often escalated into full-scale warfare, such as the Hundred Years' War . By the end of the period, the Byzantine Empire and the Balkan  states were conquered by  a new Muslim power: the Ottoman Empire ; in the Iberian Peninsula , Christian kingdoms won their centuries-old war  against their Muslim neighbours. The prominence of personal faith is well documented, but the Western Schism  and dissident movements condemned as heresies  presented a significant challenge to traditional power structures in the Western Church. Humanist  scholars began to emphasise human dignity, and Early Renaissance  architects and artists revived several elements of classical culture in Italy. During the last medieval century, naval expeditions in search for new trade routes  introduced the Age of Discovery .

Terminology and periodisation
The Middle Ages is the second of the three major periods in the most enduring scheme of analysing European history : antiquity , the Middle Ages and the modern era .[1] The Italian Leonardo Bruni  (d. 1444) was the first to use tripartite periodisation  in 1442,[2] and it became standard with the German historian Christoph Cellarius  (d. 1707).[note 1][4] The adjective "medieval", pertaining to the Middle Ages,[5] derives from medium aevum ("middle age"), a Neo-Latin  term first recorded in 1604.[6] It is also spelt "mediaeval" or "mediæval".[5][6]
It customarily spans the period between c. 500 and 1500, but its start and end years are arbitrary.[7][8][9] A common starting point, first used by Bruni, is 476: the year the last Western Roman Emperor  was deposed.[2][10] As an alternative, the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great  (r. 306–337) to Christianity is cited. There is no universally-agreed-upon end date; the most frequently-used dates include 1453 (the fall of Constantinople ), 1492 (Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to the Americas ), and 1517 (the beginning of the Protestant Reformation ).[11]
Europe, according to historian Miri Rubin , "did not live to a single rhythm over this period". Christianisation , the conversion of Europe to Christianity , took place in waves, and (re)urbanisation  began in different regions at different times.[9] Scholarly consensus characterises the period by the economic predominance of agriculture, exploitation of the peasantry, the importance of interpersonal relations —violence, patronage , kinship, and charisma —in power structures, slow inter-regional communication, and a fragile state bureaucracy.[12]
Historians from Romance language-speaking  countries tend to divide the Middle Ages into two parts: early ("high") and late ("low"). English-speaking historians, following their German counterparts, generally subdivide the period into thirds: Early , High , and Late .[13] During the 19th century, the Middle Ages were often known as the Dark Ages ; with the adoption of the three subdivisions in the early 20th century, however, use of that term was restricted to the Early Middle Ages.[14] Historians who regard the Middle Ages as a Eurocentric  concept tend to avoid its use in global history , although studies of "Medieval India ", the "Muslim Middle Ages", and similar subjects are not uncommon.[15][16]

Sources
See also: Cartulary  and historical source 
Certain aspects of medieval society (including the lives of women  or slaves ) are poorly documented, which limits a comprehensive study of the period.[17] The systematic publication of medieval written sources began with the Rerum italicarum scriptores  by Ludovico Muratori  (d. 1750), which was followed by similar series such as the Monumenta Germaniae Historica  in Germany  and the Rolls Series  in the United Kingdom. These large collections primarily contain annals , chronicles  and other narrative sources focusing on the deeds of powerful men.[18] Professional historians treat medieval narratives cautiously, since they are often filled with distorted facts or unrealistic information.[19] Documents of state or church administration such as royal charters  and chrysobulls  are indispensable sources of medieval history, although many are forged.[20] Other written sources include graffiti , seals , and letters.[21]
Since the 1950s, archaeology  has significantly contributed to studying the history of poorly-documented regions, periods, and groups (such as peasantry); chronological dating , however, is still uncertain.[22][23] Legislation may influence archaeological research. New finds of coins and hoards  are frequently exhibited in jurisdictions with liberal regulation such as England and Wales, but in other countries (such as Italy) finds from unofficial excavations are seldom published.[24] Although medieval images and sculptures may provide useful information about everyday life, a critical approach is necessary; irony, satire, and anachronism were popular stylistic devices of medieval artists.[25]

Later Roman Empire

See also: Fall of the Western Roman Empire 
The Roman Empire  reached its greatest territorial extent during the 2nd century AD, and the following two centuries saw the slow decline of Roman control of its outlying territories.[26] Runaway inflation, external pressure on the frontiers, and outbreaks of plague  combined to create the Crisis of the Third Century .[27] The army doubled in size[28] and military expenses steadily increased, primarily in response to the war  with the Sasanian Empire .[29] The need for revenue led to increased taxes, more centralised and bureaucratic state administration, and a decline in numbers of the curial  (landowning) class.[29][28] Emperor Diocletian  (r. 284–305) split the empire into separately-administered eastern  and western halves  in 286. This system, which eventually had two senior  and two junior co-emperors  (known as the Tetrarchy ) stabilised the imperial government for about two decades.[30] After a period of civil war , Constantine the Great restored internal peace and re-founded the city of Byzantium  as the eastern capital of Constantinople  in 330.[31]
Roman society stabilised in a new form which differed from the earlier classical period , with a widening gulf between rich and poor and a decline in the vitality of smaller towns.[32] Another change was the Christianisation of the Roman Empire  accelerated by the conversion of Constantine, although Christianity emerged as the empire's dominant religion only at the end of the 4th century.[33] Debates about Christian theology  intensified, and those who persisted with theological views condemned at the ecumenical councils  faced persecution. Heretical views  survived through proselytising campaigns outside the empire or because of local ethnic-group support; examples include Arianism  among the Germanic peoples and monophysitism  in Egypt and Syria.[34][35]
Judaism  remained tolerated, although legislation limited Jewish  rights.[36]
The early Christians  developed their own symbolism  by the 3rd century, often by reinterpreting popular motifs of pagan Roman art .[37] The solemnity of later Roman artists' abstract style effectively visualised Christian messages,[38] and Christ's enthroned figure  became a principal element of early Christian art .[39] Under Constantine, basilicas  (large halls which had been used for administrative and commercial purposes) were adapted for Christian worship.[40] The first illuminated manuscripts —hand-written books decorated with colourful miniatures—were produced with the spread of silent reading  in the 5th century.[41]
Civil wars between rival emperors diverted soldiers from the empire's frontier forces, allowing invaders  to encroach beginning in the mid-4th century.[42] Although these movements of peoples have been described as "invasions", they were often not just military expeditions but mass migrations  into the empire.[43] In 376, hundreds of thousands of Goths  fleeing from the Huns  received permission from Emperor Valens  (r. 364–78) to settle in Roman territory in the Balkans . The settlement did not go smoothly and, when Roman officials mishandled the situation, the Goths began to raid and plunder. Valens, attempting to put down the disorder, was killed fighting the Goths at the Battle of Adrianople .[44] The Alans , Vandals , and Suebi  crossed into Gaul  in 406, and into present-day Spain in 409; a year later, the Visigoths  (a Gothic group) sacked the city of Rome .[45][46] The Franks , Alemanni , and the Burgundians  ended up in Gaul; the Germanic groups now collectively known as Anglo-Saxons
settled in Britain ,[47] and the Vandals conquered the province  of Africa .[48] The Hunnic king Attila  (r. 434–53) led invasions into the Balkans in 442 and 447, Gaul in 451 and Italy in 452, but his Hunnic confederation  fell apart after his death.[49]
To deal with the migrations, the Eastern Roman elites combined the deployment of armed forces with gifts and grants of offices to the tribal leaders; the Western aristocrats failed to support the army and refused to pay tribute to prevent invasions by the tribes.[43] These invasions led to the division of the western part of the empire into smaller political units, ruled by the invading tribes.[50] The 5th-century emperors were often controlled by military strongmen such as Stilicho  (d. 408), Aetius  (d. 454), Ricimer  (d. 472), or Odoacer  (d. 493), who were partly (or fully) non-Roman.[51] Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus  (r. 475–76), the last western emperor, assumed the title of rex  (king) and took full control of Italy, although in theory he ruled as a representative of the eastern emperor Zeno  (r. 474–91).[52] The Eastern Roman Empire (known as the Byzantine Empire after the fall of its western counterpart) had little ability to control the lost western territories, but its emperors  maintained a claim on them.[53]

Early Middle Ages

Post-Roman kingdoms
Main article: Barbarian kingdoms 
In the post-Roman world, the fusion of Roman culture with the customs of the invading tribes is well documented. Popular assemblies , which allowed free male tribal members more say in political matters than had been common in the Roman state, developed into legislative and judicial bodies.[54] Much of the scholarly and written culture of the new political entities was based on Roman intellectual traditions.[55] Many no longer supported their armies through taxes, instead relying on granting them land or rent; with less need for large tax revenues, the taxation systems  declined.[56]
In Britain, the Celtic Britons ' culture had little impact on the Anglo-Saxon way of life, but the linguistic assimilation of the natives to the newcomers is evident. By c. 600, new political centres emerged; some local leaders accumulated considerable wealth, and a number of small kingdoms  (such as Wessex  and Mercia ) were formed. Smaller kingdoms in present-day Wales  and Scotland  were still under the control of the native Britons and Picts .[57]
Ireland  was divided into even smaller political units, perhaps as many as 150 tribal kingdoms .[58]
The Ostrogoths  moved to Italy from the Balkans under Theoderic the Great  (r. 493–526). He set up a kingdom  marked by its co-operation between the natives and the conquerors. Power struggles between Romanised and traditionalist Ostrogothic groups followed his death, providing the opportunity for the Byzantines to reconquer Italy .[59] The Burgundians settled in Gaul, where they reorganised their kingdom .[60] Elsewhere in Gaul, the Franks and Celtic Britons established stable polities. Francia  was centred in northern Gaul, and the first king about whom much is known is Childeric I  (d. 481). Under his son Clovis I  (r. 509–11), the founder of the Merovingian dynasty , the Frankish kingdom expanded and converted to Christianity.[61] Unlike other Germanic peoples, the Franks preferred mainstream Christianity to Arianism; this facilitated their cooperation with the native Gallo-Roman  aristocracy.[62] Britons fleeing from Britannia—present-day Great Britain—settled in what is now Brittany .[note 2][63]
Other monarchies were established by the Visigoths  in the Iberian Peninsula , the Suebi  in northwestern Iberia, the Vandals  in North Africa ,[64] and the Lombards  in northern Italy .[65] Coming from the Asian steppes, the nomadic Avars  conquered most Slavic , Turkic  and Germanic tribes in the lowlands along the lower and middle Danube by the end of the 6th century.[66] Another steppe people (the Bulgars ) defeated  a Byzantine imperial army in 681 and established the First Bulgarian Empire , subjugating the local Slavic tribes near the Danube Delta .[67]
The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in language. Latin , the literary language of the Western Roman Empire, was gradually replaced by vernacular  languages (which evolved from Latin) collectively known as Romance languages . Greek remained the language of the Byzantine Empire, but Slav migrations expanded the area of Slavic languages  in central  and eastern Europe .[68]
Byzantine survival
Main articles: Byzantine Empire under the Justinian dynasty  and Byzantine Empire under the Heraclian dynasty 
The Eastern Roman Empire remained intact and experienced an economic revival which lasted into the early 7th century. Political life was marked by closer relations between the political state and the Christian Church, with theological matters assuming an importance in Eastern politics that they did not have in Western Europe.[69] Legal developments included the codification of Roman law ;[70] the most comprehensive compilation, the Corpus Juris Civilis , was made under Emperor Justinian  (r. 527–65).[71] The Byzantines regularly employed eunuchs  for administrative tasks or as guardians or tutors of women and children, since they considered castrated men exceptionally intelligent and loyal servants.[72]
Justinian nearly died during the Nika riots , a popular revolt that destroyed half of Constantinople in 532. After crushing the revolt, he reinforced the autocratic elements of the imperial government and mobilised his troops against the western Arian kingdoms. The general Belisarius  (d. 565) seized North Africa from the Vandals  and attacked the Ostrogoths, but his campaign was interrupted by an unexpected Sasanian invasion from the east. Between 541 and 543, a deadly outbreak of plague  decimated the empire. Justinian developed an extensive system of border forts to compensate for the lack of military personnel, but stopped maintaining the public roads . He resumed his expansionism in a decade, completing the conquest of the Ostrogothic kingdom and seizing much of southern Spain from the Visigoths.[73]
Justinian's re-conquests and building program have been criticised by historians for bringing his realm to the brink of bankruptcy, but many of the difficulties faced by his successors were due to other factors (including the massive expansion of the Avars and their Slav allies).[74] Eastern border defences collapsed during a new war  with the Sasanian Empire, and the Persians seized Egypt, Syria, and much of Anatolia . The Avars, Slavs and Persians attacked Constantinople in 626 , but could not conquer it. Emperor Heraclius  (r. 610–41) launched an unexpected counterattack against the heart of the Sassanian Empire two years later, recovering the territories previously lost to the Persians.[75]
Western society
See also: Early medieval European dress 
In Western Europe, values attached to Latin scholarship  and education  largely disappeared. Although literacy remained important, it became a practical skill rather than an indication of status. By the late 6th century, the principal means of religious instruction were music and art rather than books.[76] Most intellectual efforts imitated classical scholarship, but some original works  were also created. The writings of Sidonius Apollinaris  (d. 489), Cassiodorus  (d. c. 585), and Boethius  (d. c. 525) were typical of the age.[77] Aristocratic culture focused on great feasts rather than literary pursuits. Family ties among the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour; these ties led to the prevalence of feuds in aristocratic society. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly, with the payment of compensation .[78]
Women participated in aristocratic society primarily as wives and mothers, with the mother of an underage ruler especially prominent in Francia.  The lack of many child rulers in Anglo-Saxon society meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was countered by the increased role played by abbesses  of monasteries.[79] Women's influence on politics was fragile, and early medieval authors tended to depict powerful women in a bad light.[note 3][81] Women were more respected in Scandinavian societies; a Viking  woman could demand compensation from her husband for domestic violence , act as a seeress , or even command ships.[note 4][83] Women usually died at a considerably younger age than men, primarily due to complications at childbirth . The disparity in numbers between marriageable women and men led to the detailed regulation of legal institutions protecting women's interests, including their right to the Morgengabe  ("morning gift").[84] Early medieval laws acknowledged a man's right to have long-term sexual relationships with women other than his wife (such as concubines ), but women were expected to remain faithful. Clerics censured sexual unions outside marriage, and monogamy  also became the norm of secular law in the 9th century.[85]
Landholding  patterns were not uniform; some areas had greatly fragmented holdings but large, contiguous blocks of land were the norm in other areas. These differences permitted a wide variety of peasant societies, some dominated by aristocratic landholders and others with a great deal of autonomy.[86] Land settlement also varied greatly. Some peasants lived in large settlements with as many as 700 inhabitants, and others on isolated farms.[87] Since legislation made a clear distinction between free and unfree, there was no sharp difference between the legal status of the free peasant and the aristocrat; it was possible for a free peasant's family to rise to the aristocracy through military service.[88] Demand for slaves was covered with warring and raids. After the Anglo-Saxons' conversion to Christianity, slave hunters mainly targeted the pagan Slav tribes; the English word "slave" derives from slavicus, the Medieval Latin  term for Slavs.[89] Christian ethics brought about significant changes in the position of slaves during the 7th and 8th centuries, since their right to a more humane treatment was enacted.[90]
City life and culture were declining. Although the northern Italian cities remained inhabited, they decreased significantly in size.[note 5][92] Cities also shrank in northern Europe,  and civic monuments and other public buildings were raided for building materials.[93] Jewish communities survived in Spain, southern Gaul and Italy. The Visigothic kings made concentrated efforts to convert the Hispanic Jews  to Christianity, but the Jewish community quickly revived  after the Muslim conquest of Spain .[94] Muslim rulers employed Jewish courtiers,[95] but Christian legislation forbade the appointment of Jews to government positions.[96]
Rise of Islam
Main articles: Spread of Islam  and Early Muslim conquests 
Religious beliefs were in flux along the Eastern Roman and Persian frontiers, as state-sponsored Roman missionaries proselytised among the pagan steppe peoples and the Persians made attempts to enforce Zoroastrianism  on the Christian Armenians .[97] The emergence of Islam  in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad  (d. 632) brought about more radical changes. After his death, Islamic forces conquered Syria , Persia , and Egypt . The Eastern Romans halted the Muslim expansion at Constantinople in 674–78  and 717–18 ; in the west, Islamic troops conquered North Africa , annihilated the Visigothic Kingdom  in 711, and invaded southern Gaul  beginning in 713.[98]
The conquerors bypassed the mountainous northwestern region of the Iberian Peninsula and a small kingdom, Asturias , emerged as the centre of local resistance.[99] The defeat of Muslim  forces at the Battle of Tours  in 732 led to the reconquest of southern France by the Franks, but the main reason for the halt of Islamic growth in Europe was the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate  and its replacement by the Abbasid Caliphate . The Abbasids were concerned with the Middle East, losing control of portions of the Muslim lands in the west. Umayyad descendants took over Al-Andalus  (or Muslim Spain), the Aghlabids  controlled North Africa, and the Tulunids  became rulers of Egypt.[100] The Islamisation of the countryside in Al-Andalus was slow. Christians were regularly employed in state administration, but violent inter-religious conflicts could lead to their mass migration to the north.[101] Except for Byzantium, Muslim Spain was the only place in Europe where eunuchs played a preeminent role in administration and social life, holding positions such as guardians of religious shrines or harem  servants.[102]
Trade and economy
See also: Saqaliba 
As migrations and conquests disrupted trade networks throughout the old Roman lands, goods from long-range trade were replaced with local products. Non-local goods in the archaeological record are usually luxury goods or metal works.[103] In the 7th and 8th centuries, new commercial networks were developing in northern Europe. Goods such as furs, walrus ivory  and amber were delivered from the Baltic region to western Europe, triggering the establishment of toll  stations and conflicts over their control.[104] In the post-Roman kingdoms, base metal
coinage  nearly ceased but bronze Roman coins remained in circulation. Although gold coins were struck, they were mainly used for extraordinary expenditures such as the purchase of land or luxury goods. A shift from gold coinage to the mint of silver pennies began in the late 7th century, with the cessation of Byzantine subsidy payments to the Lombards and Franks. The elites' new emphasis on Christian charity also increased the demand for coins of lower value.[105]
The flourishing Islamic economies' constant demand for fresh labour force and raw materials opened a new market for Europe c. 750. The continent emerged as a major supplier of house slaves  and slave soldiers  for Al-Andalus, northern Africa and the Levant .[106][107] In addition, timber, fur and arms were delivered from Europe to the Mediterranean; Europe imported spices, medicine, incense, and silk.[108] Large rivers, connecting distant regions, facilitated the expansion of transcontinental trade.[109] Contemporaneous reports indicate that Anglo-Saxon merchants visited fairs at Paris, pirates preyed on tradesmen on the Danube, and Eastern Frankish merchants reached as far as Zaragoza  in Al-Andalus.[110]
Church life
The idea of Christian unity endured, although differences in ideology and practice between the Eastern and Western Churches were increasing.[111] Native Roman aversion to Arian conquerors reinforced the traditional Christian concept of the separation of church and state  in the west; this concept was alien to eastern clergymen, however, who regarded the Roman state as an instrument of divine providence.[111] After the Muslim conquests, Byzantine emperors could less effectively intervene in the west. When Leo III  (r. 717–41) prohibited the display of paintings of human figures in places of worship, the papacy  rejected his claim  to declare new dogmas with imperial edicts.[112] Although the Byzantine Church condemned iconoclasm  in 843, issues such as the rivalry for ecclesiastic jurisdiction over newly-converted peoples and the unilateral modification  of the Nicene Creed  in the west widened to the extent that differences were greater than similarities.[113] In the west, the tithe  (originally a voluntarily contribution) began to be levied as a church tax  on agrarian products during the 10th century.[114]
Few western bishops  looked to the papacy for leadership. The only part of Western Europe where the papacy had influence was Britain, where Gregory the Great  (pope 590–604) had sent a mission  to convert the Anglo-Saxons to Christianity.[115] Church attendance was low, and meetings with itinerant clergy and pilgrimages  to popular saints' shrines  were instrumental in religious education.[116]
Irish missionaries  were most active in Western Europe between the 5th and 7th centuries.[117] They were the first to use handbooks, known as penitentials , to determine appropriate acts of penance —typically prayers and fasts —for sinners . They emphasised sexual morality  and prescribed severe penances for adulterers, fornicators  and those engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts (such as homosexuals ).[118] In contrast with official Christianity, the Bogomils  in the Balkans condemned sexual reproduction because they considered Satan the creator of the physical universe.[119]
The Early Middle Ages saw the rise of Christian monasticism . Monastic ideals spread from Egypt  in hagiographical literature , especially the Life of Anthony . Most European monasteries focused on community experience of the spiritual life, known as cenobitism .[120] The Italian monk Benedict of Nursia  (d. 547) developed the Benedictine Rule , which was widely used in western monasteries.[121] In the east, monastic rules compiled by Theodore the Studite  (d. 826) gained popularity after they were adopted in the Great Lavra  on Mount Athos  during the 960s.[122]
Monasteries had a deep effect on local society, acting as land trusts  for powerful families and centres of political authority;[123] they were the main (and sometimes only) outposts of education and literacy in a region. Many surviving manuscripts of the Latin classics  were copied by monks.[124] Monks were also the authors of new works on history, theology, and other subjects by authors such as Bede  (d. 735), a native of northern England.[125] The Byzantine missionary Constantine  (d. 869) developed Old Church Slavonic  as a new liturgical language , establishing the basis for a flourishing Slavic religious literature; a new script was adopted c. 900, now known for Constantine's monastic name  as Cyrillic .[126] The Saxon  nun Hrosvitha  (d. 1000) wrote the first non-liturgical medieval dramas.[127][128]
In Western Christendom, lay  influence over church affairs reached its apex during the 10th century. Aristocrats regarded the churches and monasteries under their patronage  as their personal property , and simony —the sale of church offices—was a common practice. Simony aroused a general fear, since many believed that irregularly-appointed priests could not confer valid sacraments  such as baptism .[129] Monastic communities were the first to react to this fear with rigorous observance of their rules. The establishment of Cluny Abbey  in Burgundy  in 909 initiated a more radical change, since Cluny was freed from lay control and placed under the protection of the papacy. The Cluniac Reforms  indicated that the reformist idea of the "Liberty of the Church " could be achieved with submission to the papacy.[130]
Carolingian Europe
Main article: Carolingian Empire 
The Merovingian kings customarily distributed Francia among their sons and destroyed their own power base with extensive land grants. In the northeastern Frankish kingdom of Austrasia , the Arnulfings  were the most prominent beneficiaries of royal favour. As hereditary Mayors of the Palace , they were the power behind the throne beginning in the mid-7th century. One, Pepin of Herstal  (d. 714), also assumed power in the central Frankish realm of Neustria . His son, Charles Martel  (d. 741), took advantage of the permanent Muslim threat to confiscate church property and raise troops by parcelling it out to the recruits.[131]
The Carolingians , as Charles Martel's descendants are known, succeeded the Merovingians as the royal dynasty of Francia in 751. The Merovingian king Childeric III  (r. 743–51) was deposed that year, and Charles Martel's son Pepin the Short  (r. 751–68) was crowned king with the consent of the Frankish leaders and the papacy. Pepin attacked the Lombards, enforcing their promise to respect papal possessions . His subsequent donation of central Italian territories  to the Holy See  marked the beginning of the Papal States .[132][133]
Pepin left his kingdom in the hands of his sons: Charles, more often known as Charlemagne  (r. 768–814), and Carloman  (r. 768–71). When Carloman died, Charlemagne reunited Francia and embarked on a programme of expansion. He subjugated  the Saxons, conquered the Lombards, and created a border province  in northern Spain.[134] Frankish troops also destroyed  the Avars, facilitating the development of small Slav principalities primarily ruled by ambitious warlords under Frankish suzerainty.[note 6][136] The coronation of Charlemagne as emperor on Christmas Day 800 marked the return of the Western Roman Empire, although the Byzantines did not recognise him as a second "emperor of the Romans".[137]
His empire was administered by an itinerant court that travelled with the emperor and about 300 imperial officials (known as counts ), who administered the empire's counties .[138] The central administration supervised the counts with imperial emissaries, known as missi dominici , who were roving inspectors and troubleshooters. The clerics of the royal chapel  were responsible for recording important royal grants and decisions.[139]
Charlemagne's court was the centre of the cultural revival sometimes known as the Carolingian Renaissance . Literacy increased with development of the arts, architecture and jurisprudence, and liturgical and scriptural studies under the auspices of the Anglo-Saxon scholar Alcuin  (d. 804). He developed a script , presently known as Carolingian minuscule , which facilitated reading with the clear separation of words and the extensive use of punctuation. Charlemagne sponsored changes in church liturgy , imposing the Roman form of worship on his domains and Gregorian chant  in liturgical music for the churches.[140]
Breakup of the Carolingian Empire
Main articles: East Francia , Middle Francia , West Francia , and Viking Age 
Territorial divisions of the Carolingian Empire  in 843, 855, and 870
Charlemagne continued the Frankish tradition of dividing his empire between his sons, but only one son –
Louis the Pious  (r. 814–40) –
was still alive by 813. Louis's reign was marked by divisions of the empire among his sons and civil wars between various alliances of father and sons. Three years after his death, his three surviving sons divided the empire among themselves in the Treaty of Verdun .[141] A kingdom between the Rhine  and Rhone  rivers was created for Lothair I  (r. 817–55) to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German  (r. 843–76) controlled the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald  (r. 843–77) received the western Frankish lands making up most of modern-day France.[142] Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms among their descendants, eventually destroying all internal cohesion.[143]
There was a brief reunion of the empire by Charles the Fat  in 884, although its units retained separate administrations.[144] By his death, early in 888, the Carolingians were close to extinction; non-dynastic claimants assumed power in most of the successor states, such as the Parisian count Odo  in Francia (r. 888–98).[145] In the eastern lands, the dynasty ended with the death of Louis the Child  (r. 899–911) and the selection of the Franconian  duke Conrad I  (r. 911–18) as king.[146] The dynasty was restored in West Francia in 898 and 936, but the last Carolingians could not control the aristocracy. In 987, the dynasty was replaced with the crowning of powerful aristocrat Hugh Capet  (r. 987–96) as king.[note 7][147]
Frankish culture and the Carolingian methods of state administration had a significant impact on neighboring peoples. Frankish threat triggered the formation of new states along the empire's eastern frontier: Bohemia , Moravia , and Croatia .[148] The breakup of the Carolingian Empire was accompanied by invasions, migrations, and raids by external foes. The Atlantic and northern shores were harassed by the Vikings, who also raided the British Isles  and settled there. In 911, the Viking chieftain Rollo  (d. c. 931) received permission from the Frankish king Charles the Simple  (r. 898–922) to settle in present-day Normandy . The eastern parts of the Frankish kingdoms, especially Germany and Italy, were under continual Magyar assault  until the invaders were defeated at the Battle of Lechfeld  in 955.[149] In the Mediterranean, Arab pirates launched regular raids against Italy and southern France; the Aghlabids conquered Sicily , and the Umayyads of Al-Andalus annexed the Balearic Islands .[150]
New kingdoms and Byzantine revival
See also: Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty , Byzantine–Arab wars (780–1180) , Byzantine–Bulgarian wars , Christianisation of Bulgaria , and Christianisation of Kievan Rus' 
The Viking settlement in the British Isles led to the formation of new political entities, including the small (but militant) Kingdom of Dublin  in Ireland.[151] The Anglo-Saxon king Alfred the Great  (r. 871–99) reached an agreement with Danish invaders  in 879, acknowledging the existence of an independent Viking realm  in Britain.[152][153] By the middle of the 10th century, Alfred's successors had restored Anglo-Saxon control of the territory.[154] In northern Britain, Kenneth MacAlpin  (d. c. 860) united the Picts and the Scots  into the Kingdom of Alba .[155]
The Ottonian dynasty  established itself in Germany  in the early 10th century, driving back the Magyars and fighting the disobedient dukes . After an appeal by the widowed Queen Adelaide of Italy  (d. 999) for protection, Otto I  (r. 936–73) crossed the Alps into Italy, married the young widow and had himself crowned king in Pavia  in 951. His coronation as Holy Roman Emperor  in Rome in 962 demonstrated his claim to Charlemagne's legacy.[156] Otto's successors remained keenly interested in Italian affairs, but the absentee German kings were unable to assert permanent authority over the local aristocracy.[157] In the Iberian Peninsula, the Basque
fight for independence  led to the formation of the Kingdom of Navarre  and the counts of Barcelona  gained autonomy in the Carolingian border province. Asturias expanded slowly south, and continued as the Kingdom of León .[158][159]
The Eastern European trade routes towards Asia were controlled by the Khazars . Their multi-ethnic empire resisted  the Muslim expansion, and their leaders converted to Judaism.[160] A new trade route developed at the end of the 9th century, bypassing Khazar territory and connecting Central Asia with Europe across Volga Bulgaria ; the local inhabitants converted to Islam.[161] Swedish traders and slave hunters ranged down the rivers of the East European Plain , captured Kyiv  from the Khazars, and attempted to seize Constantinople in 860  and 907 . Contacts with Francia paved the way for missionary efforts by Christian clergy in Scandinavia, and Christianisation  was closely associated with the growth of centralised kingdoms in Denmark , Norway , and Sweden .[162] Norse colonists settled in Iceland  and created a political system  that hindered the accumulation of power by ambitious chieftains .[163]
Byzantium revived under Emperor Basil I  (r. 867–86) and his successors Leo VI  (r. 886–912) and Constantine VII  (r. 913–59), members of the Macedonian dynasty . The imperial court was the centre of a rebirth of classical learning known as the Macedonian Renaissance . The military was reorganised, which allowed the emperors John I  (r. 969–76) and Basil II  (r. 976–1025) to expand the empire's frontiers.[164]
Missionary efforts by Eastern and Western clergy resulted in the conversion of the Moravians , Danubian Bulgars, Czechs , Poles , Magyars, and the inhabitants of the Kievan Rus' .[165] After Moravia fell due to Magyar invasions 
c. 900, dukes of the Czech Přemyslid dynasty  consolidated authority in Bohemia.[166] In Poland , the destruction of old power centres accompanied the formation of the state under the Piast dukes .[167] In Hungary , the princes of the Árpád dynasty  used extensive violence to crush opposition by rival Magyar chieftains.[168] The Rurikid princes  of Kievan Rus' emerged as the rulers of East Europe's vast forest zones after Rus'  raiders sacked the Khazar capital, Atil , in 965.[169] Bulgaria was annexed by  the Byzantines between 971 and 1018.[148][170]
Architecture and art
See also: Migration Period art  and pre-Romanesque art and architecture 
New basilicas  were built in the major Roman cities and post-Roman kingdoms from the 4th to the 6th centuries.[note 8][171] Byzantine church architecture adopted an alternative model imitating the rectangular plan and the dome  of Justinian's Hagia Sophia , the largest single-roofed structure in the Roman world.[172] As the spacious basilicas became less useful with the decline of urban centres in the west, they gave way to smaller churches until the basilica form of architecture revived in the Carolingian Empire.[173] A new standard feature of Carolingian basilicas is the use of a transept : the "arms" of a T-shaped building which are perpendicular to the long nave .[174] In Al-Andalus, the Great Mosque of Córdoba  became an extraordinary example of Moorish architecture .[175]
Halls built of timber or stone were the centres of political and social life. Their design often adopted elements of later Roman architecture such as pilasters , columns, and sculptured discs.[note 9][176] After the disintegration of the Carolingian Empire, the spread of aristocratic castles indicates a transition from communal fortifications to private defence. Most castles were wooden structures, but the wealthiest lords built stone fortresses.[note 10] One or more towers (now known as keeps ) were their most characteristic features, but castles often developed into multi-functional compounds with drawbridges , fortified courtyards, cisterns  or wells, halls, chapels, stables and workshops.[178]
Gold pouring into the tribal leaders from the Roman Empire was regularly remoulded into new artifacts, such as massive necklaces and eagle-shaped fibulae , by local goldsmiths. Their unrealistic style, often influenced by Iranian polychrome  and cloisonné  metal works, was introduced into Roman territory by the invading peoples.[179] Artisans working for post-Roman elites developed a distinct, abstract design characterised by ribbons and highly-stylised animal motifs .[180]
Literary works  such as the Old English  epic poem Beowulf  and the Nordic sagas  refer to great royal treasures, but only a few of them survived; they included grave goods  from Childeric's tomb at Tournai  and the rich Anglo-Saxon burial at Sutton Hoo . Religious art quickly assimilated several elements of secular style, such as strapwork  ornamenting and extensive segmentation.[181] Paintings have mostly survived in richly-decorated Gospel Books , including the Book of Kells  and the Lindisfarne Gospels —two examples of the Insular art  of Ireland and Northumbria.[note 11][183]
The Hellenistic  tradition of realistic portrayal survived in the Mediterranean.[184] Although the iconoclastic movement restricted Byzantine art , the iconophiles'  triumph paved the way for an artistic renewal .[note 12][186] The more naturalistic Mediterranean style was an important inspiration for western artists under Charlemagne, who considered the visual arts a powerful instrument of education and propaganda.[187] After a long pause, Carolingian art  rediscovered the human figure and Western artists often depicted people in illuminated codices .[note 13] These were often protected by sumptuous book covers  made of gold, pearls, and polished gemstones .[188] Charlemagne's court seems to have been responsible for the acceptance of figurative monumental sculpture  in Christian art [189] and, by the end of the period, near-life-sized figures such as the Gero Cross  were common in important churches.[190] In England, book illuminators  freely enriched their Insular heritage with Carolingian motifs such as sprigs of foliage. In post-Carolingian Germany, manuscripts illustrated with lively pictorial cycles indicate the impact of contemporary Byzantine art on Ottonian artists . In Christian Spain, artists adopted Islamic decorative  motifs such as Kufic  letters and Moorish arches .[191]
Military and technology
The creation of heavily-armoured cataphract -type soldiers as cavalry was an important feature of the later Roman military, although the deployment of highly-specialised troops continued. The invading tribes had different emphases on types of soldiers, ranging from the primarily-infantry Anglo-Saxon invaders of Britain to the Vandals and Visigoths, who had a high proportion of cavalry in their armies.[192] The greatest change in military affairs was the adoption of the Hunnic composite bow  in place of the weaker Scythian  composite bow.[193] The Avar heavy cavalry  introduced the use of stirrups  in Europe,[194] and it was adopted by Byzantine cavalrymen before the end of the 6th century.[195] Another development was the increasing use of longswords  and the progressive replacement of scale armour  by mail  and lamellar armour .[196]
The importance of infantry and light cavalry began to decline during the early Carolingian period with the increasing dominance of elite heavy cavalry, although a large proportion of the armies appear to have been mounted infantry  rather than true cavalry.[197] The use of militia-type levies  of the free population declined. One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies known as the fyrd .[198] In military technology, one of the main changes was the reappearance of the crossbow  as a military weapon.[199] A technological advance with implications beyond the military was the horseshoe , which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain.[200]

Museum of Witchcraft and Magic
Established: 1951 (1951)
Location Boscastle , Cornwall 
Director: Simon Costin
Website http://www.museumofwitchcraftandmagic.co.uk/ 
The Museum of Witchcraft and Magic, formerly known as the Museum of Witchcraft, is a museum dedicated to European witchcraft  and magic  located in the village of Boscastle  in Cornwall , south-west England. It houses exhibits devoted to folk magic, ceremonial magic , Freemasonry , and Wicca , with its collection of such objects having been described as the largest in the world.
The museum was founded by the English folk magician Cecil Williamson  in 1951 to display his own personal collection of artefacts. Initially known as the Folklore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft, it was located in the town of Castletown  on the Isle of Man . Williamson was assisted at the museum by the prominent Wiccan Gerald Gardner , who remained there as "resident witch". After their friendship deteriorated, Gardner purchased it from Williamson in 1954, renaming it the Museum of Magic and Witchcraft. Gardner's Castletown museum remained open until the 1970s, when Gardner's heir Monique Wilson  sold its contents to the Ripley's  company.
In 1954, Williamson opened his own rival back in England, known as the Museum of Witchcraft. Its first location was at Windsor, Berkshire , and the next at Bourton-on-the-Water , Gloucestershire ; in both cases it faced violent opposition and Williamson felt it necessary to move, establishing the museum in Boscastle in 1960. In 1996 Williamson sold the museum to Graham King, who incorporated the Richel collection of magical regalia from the Netherlands in 2000. The museum was damaged and part of its collection lost during the Boscastle flood of 2004 . In 2013 ownership was transferred to Simon Costin and his Museum of British Folklore.
The museum is a popular tourist attraction and is held in high esteem by the British occult community. A charity, Friends of the Museum of Witchcraft, has been established to raise funds for the exhibits. The museum also contains a large library on related topics that is accessible to researchers.

History
Origins: 1947–60
After the Second World War, the former film producer Cecil Williamson  decided to move into the museum business, and—probably influenced by personal interest—decided to open one that would be devoted to the subject of witchcraft .[1]
Williamson tried to open a museum to hold his collection of witchcraft and occult artifacts in Stratford-upon-Avon  in 1947, but faced local opposition and had to abandon his plans.[1] He then decided to open it in Castletown  on the Isle of Man , an area which had much folklore surrounding fairies  and witches, a tourist season, and local laws that were congenial to the establishment of a museum.[1] He had it set up in a dilapidated old mill known locally as the Witches' Mill which he had purchased in 1948, and, at the advice of his wife, opened an adjacent restaurant, known as the Witches' Kitchen.
The museum was first named the Folklore Centre of Superstition and Witchcraft.[2]
The launch of the museum was timed to coincide with the government's repeal of the Witchcraft and Vagrancy Acts  in June 1951.[1] In an interview with The Sunday Pictorial newspaper, Williamson claimed to be friends with at least a dozen witches, and that he had invited a coven from southern England to come and practice their rituals at his museum.[1] The historian Ronald Hutton  deemed this to "fairly clearly" be a reference to the Bricket Wood coven  which was based in Hertfordshire  and run by the Wiccan Gerald Gardner .[2] In press interviews, Gardner was described as the museum's "resident witch" and performed a magical ritual at the museum's opening ceremony.[2] For Williamson, the press interest served to promote his museum, while for Gardner it gave the opportunity to promote Wicca at a safe distance from his main coven.[2]
Williamson also had a practical interest in magic, and in a 1952 interview with popular magazine Illustrated described himself as a consultant on the subject who could help remove curses from people, akin to an old cunning man .[2] He acknowledged that he knew many of these spells from reading about them in books.[2] He took an interest in the late ceremonial magician
Aleister Crowley  and wrote to Crowley's friend Gerald Yorke  to enquire as to whether he could send him the instructions for any of Crowley's rituals.[2]
[3]
The Williamson-Gardner split: 1953–64
Williamson decided to return to England, and took his collection of witchcraft artefacts with him. In 1954 Gardner bought the Witches' Mill from him, and renamed it The Museum of Magic and Witchcraft, filling it with his own collection of artefacts. During the 1950s, Gardner discussed moving his museum to London  with his then friend, Charles Cardell , but decided not to.[4] According to the historian Ronald Hutton , this left Gardner with "a secure and congenial base" from which he could promote Wicca by writing such books as Witchcraft Today  (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959).[3]
Gardner continued to run the museum until his death in 1964, when it was briefly run by his High Priestess Monique Wilson before it was shut down and the collection sold off.
Ripley's Entertainment Inc. bought the collection and in 1972 opened the "Museum of Witchcraft and Magic" at Gatlinburg, TN and San Francisco, CA. In 1975, due to pressure from the local church and religious groups, Ripley's changed the name of the museums to the "World of the Unexplained". More attractions and items were added to the present witchcraft collection. In 1985, Ripley's closed both museums due to poor ticket sales. The collection was disbursed to other Ripley's museums. A lot of the witchcraft collection was sent to Ripley's Believe It or Not museum at Blackpool, England.In his will, Gardner left the museum to his assistant there, with the proviso that if he did not want it then it would go to his initiate Monique Wilson, which is what happened.[5]
On his return to England in 1954, Williamson opened the museum, now known as the Museum of Witchcraft, in Windsor . Here it stayed open for the tourist season, and was quite successful, but local opinion was still against it, and so Williamson decided to move it again.
In 1954 Williamson moved the museum to Bourton-on-the-Water  in Gloucestershire . The museum suffered various persecutions, including signs being painted on walls and dead cats hung from trees, and eventually it was largely damaged in an arson attack.
Boscastle: 1960-present
In 1960 Williamson moved the museum to Boscastle  in Cornwall . Williamson displayed some artefacts associated with ceremonial magic, but was largely interested in folk magic and the practices of what he called the "wayside witch".[6]
Williamson retired in 1996, selling the museum to Graham King and Liz Crow.[7]
A practising Pagan with interests in witchcraft, King owned a business manufacturing specialist cameras in Hampshire  when he discovered that the museum was for sale in a newspaper article.[7] King and Williamson finalised the purchase at midnight on Halloween 1996.[7] King and Crow reorganised the museum and removed some of the more sensationalist exhibits, such as a partially clothed female mannequin which had been laid on an altar to represent the Black Mass .[8]
King appeared on BBC  television series such as A Seaside Parish  and Antiques Roadshow . He organised the burial of Joan Wytte, a woman who died in Bodmin Jail  under accusations of witchcraft in 1813, and whose corpse had been at the museum for many years. She was buried in a local area of woodland in 1998.[9] The museum was damaged during heavy floods  in August 2004,[10] resulting in it being closed for repairs until March 2005.[8]
After King took over, a group known as the Friends of the Museum was established; it holds an annual weekend of lectures.[11] It was subsequently converted into a charity.[11] To commemorate the museum's sixtieth anniversary, in 2011 the Occult Art Company published an anthology entitled The Museum of Witchcraft: A Magical History. The idea for the work had been provided by the chair of the Friends, Judith Noble, with the volume itself being edited by Kerrian Godwin.[12] It contained contributions from 51 individuals involved in the esoteric and Pagan communities, including prominent figures like Ronald Hutton , Philip Heselton , Patricia Crowther , and Marian Green .[12]
Reviewed by Pagan studies  scholar Ethan Doyle White in The Pomegranate  journal, he welcomed the volume yet described its contents as a "mixed bag, with the articles varying in their quality and relevance to the subject at hand."[12]
On Halloween 2013 King transferred ownership of the museum, its collection and library, to the designer and curator Simon Costin, who had founded the Museum of British Folklore in 2009.[13] King retained ownership of the museum's building, which was leased to Costin's Museum.[13]
Costin informed the Cornish Guardian  that "The museum will continue to run exactly as it is. It won't change at all."[13]

Exhibits
In keeping with Williamson's original plan, most of the exhibits in the museum feature artefacts related to historical folk magic and the cunning folk .[8] This includes a room which recreates a tradition cunning woman's cottage, termed "Joan's cottage", with a mannequin of a nineteenth century cunning woman, surrounded by various herbs and divination tools.[14] The museum also contains exhibits devoted to the witch trials in the early modern period , the modern Pagan religion of Wicca , as well as other esoteric practices such as ceremonial magic , Freemasonry , and alchemy . There is also a small case on modern religious Satanism , in which a distinction is drawn between it and modern Pagan witchcraft.[8]
A number of artefacts in the collection were owned by prominent figures in the history of magic and witchcraft; it contains a ritual chalice used by the Thelemite  magician Aleister Crowley , talismans created by Gerald Gardner, and ritual swords and an altar slab formerly owned by the noted Wiccan Alex Sanders .[7] The museum's collection of artefacts continues to grow with new acquisitions.[8] Many contemporary practitioners of witchcraft and magic have bequeathed their working tools to the museum in their wills.[8] According to the anthropologist Helen Cornish, the exhibits in the museum "work to build narratives that illustrate witchcraft over time, and situate it as a significant force in the present".[15]

Reception
In The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca, Rosemary Ellen Guiley described it as the "world's largest collection of paraphernalia and artifacts related to folk magic, witchcraft, Wicca and ritual magic".[16]
The museum functions as an information resource centre for media and the public.[8] An independent organisation, the Friends of the Museum of Witchcraft, operates to raise funds through which to purchase further items for the collection.[8] It also acts as a meeting place for Wiccans and other Pagans.[8]
According to Doyle White, the museum has become "something akin to a site of pilgrimage" for British Witches, with a "special and irreplaceable place in the hearts of many in the British occult community."[12]
Cornish conducted ethnographic research among the local Witches who had relationships with the museum in the late 1990s and early 2000s. She found that there were mixed views on aspects of the museum. Commenting on the "Joan's cottage" room, she found that some Witches felt that it provided "a marker of historical identification, and illustrates the ways that independent, rural magical workers provide a central focus and source of heritage, while for others it indicates an ongoing problem of romanticized historical invention."[15] Various practitioners interviewed by Cornish were sceptical about the claims that Williamson had made for many of the artefacts which he placed on exhibit, questioning whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant their continued display.[17]

The Museum of Witchcraft is an institution located in Boscastle, Cornwall, UK. It was founded by Donald William Williamson in the late 20th century and has since grown to become one of the largest collections of artefacts related to folk magic, witchcraft, Wicca, and ritual magic.

Exhibits
The museum features a range of exhibits that focus on various aspects of magical traditions and practices throughout history. The collection includes objects such as talismans created by Gerald Gardner, talismans used by Aleister Crowley, ritual swords, an altar slab formerly owned by Alex Sanders, and items related to the witch trials in early modern England.

Notable artefacts include a ritual chalice used by Aleister Crowley, which was donated by him after his death; talismans created by Gerald Gardner, such as those from his own practice; and ritual swords and an altar slab that belonged to Alex Sanders. These objects provide insight into the diverse range of magical practices and beliefs throughout history.

The museum also houses a number of exhibits dedicated to witchcraft trials in early modern England, including displays on notable figures like Joan Wytte who faced accusations of witchcraft in Bodmin Jail during the 18th century.

Reception
The Museum of Witchcraft has received praise for its extensive collection and informative displays. It is widely regarded as one of the most significant repositories of magical artefacts in the world, making it an important resource for scholars, practitioners, and enthusiasts alike. The museum serves not only as a repository but also as a meeting place where people interested in witchcraft can gather to share their knowledge and experiences.

However, some visitors have raised concerns about certain aspects of its displays, particularly regarding the authenticity or historical accuracy of some artefacts. Critics argue that many objects displayed at the museum may lack sufficient evidence to support claims made about their origins or significance.

Despite these criticisms, the Museum of Witchcraft remains a highly respected institution within the broader community of Pagan studies and Wicca enthusiasts. Its exhibits continue to grow as new acquisitions are added regularly, allowing visitors to gain deeper insights into the rich history of witchcraft and magical practices across different cultures and time periods.

A werewolf is a mythological creature in folklore that can transform into a wolf, either by choice or through a curse often triggered by a full moon. It is related to the belief of lycanthropy, which involves the affliction of changing into a wolf. The concept has roots in European traditions and was prevalent during medieval times, coinciding with witch trials. After these persecutions ended, werewolves became subjects of folklore studies and later influenced horror genres in literature and culture.
