The passage discusses werewolf folklore across different cultures and regions around the world, exploring various aspects such as causes, transformations, treatments, beliefs about revenant spirits, religious associations, and connections to other supernatural creatures. Here's a breakdown of some key points:

1. **Cultural Variations**: Werewolf myths differ significantly by region, with various explanations for their appearance and behavior:
   - In Eastern Europe, wolves were thought to be cursed or exorcized into human form, while in Scandinavia, they were believed to be malevolent.
   - Native American beliefs often featured wolf-like creatures that guarded sacred places or were responsible for killing hunters.

2. **Causation**: Causes of werewolf transformations vary widely:
   - Parental abuse was a common cause in Eastern European folklore
   - The belief that people could become wolves after passing through an arch with birch and rose spine
   - In North America, beliefs often associated lycanthropy with witchcraft or other evil spirits

3. **Transformations**: Transformations described varied:
   - Transformation into a wolf was common but not always immediate
   - Some werewolves could transform at will while others were involuntarily transformed
   - The timing of transformations (Easter, winter solstice) was often significant in some cultures

4. **Cures and Treatments**: Various methods to cure lycanthropy were used:
   - Medieval practitioners advocated medical treatments like wolfsbane or exorcism
   - The conversion to Christianity was also a common method
   - Beliefs about the power of the Devil or saintly powers for transforming others

5. **Belief in Revenants**: Werewolves were often linked to revenant spirits:
   - In Hungarian folklore, vampires and werewolves are closely related
   - The belief that the transformation was involuntary was common
   - Some versions allowed the person to choose their own animal form of transformation

6. **Associations with Other Supernatural Creatures**: Werewolves were often associated with other supernatural beings:
   - In American folklore, they were considered enemies of witches and evil spirits
   - They were sometimes depicted as hunters of vampires
